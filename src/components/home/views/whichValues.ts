    body: "1Cademy is a platform that aims to improve the efficiency of learning and research by utilizing a collaborative approach to gather information from various sources and organize it into concise notes that focus on a single concept. These notes are granularly organized and visualized as a knowledge graph that illustrates the hierarchical relationships between concepts. The platform uses a peer-review process, reputation system, and voting mechanism to ensure the quality of the knowledge graph and encourage the development of high-quality content. Through this process, students and researchers can improve upon each other's contributions, propose more up-to-date and user-friendly versions of each note and share their learning perspectives. Over the past two years, [1,543] students and researchers from [183] institutions have participated in the platform, resulting in the formation of [49] research and learning communities covering a wide range of subjects.",
