        about: `I am a sophomore currently pursuing a major in Informatics at the School of Information in the University of Michigan Ann Arbor, as well as a possible minor in Entrepreneurship and Computer Science. I am very interested in learning about technology and programming, and am planning to self teach myself certifications during this upcoming summer. I have always been interested in exploring different facets about the disability movement, including its roots, legislation that helped give more political and social representation, as well as becoming more well taught in the many different disabilities that are not discussed as often as the highly known ones. Personally, I have one of these conditions called “Hyperhidrosis”, which results in an individual sweating excessively when exposed to stress, temperatures warmer than room temperature, or any sort of physical movement. Through the Disability Studies group, I have been able to collaborate and deepen my understanding about hyperhidrosis and other aspects in Disability Studies.`,

        bachelor&#39;s in English and a minor in Anthropology. I have volunteered for both the Library of
        Congress and the Smithsonian, where I transcribed and reviewed transcriptions to improve the
        search, access, and discovery of historical and scientific documents. I also ensured these
        transcribed documents are complete and accurate. My volunteer work also included digitizing a
        variety of material to create accessibility for researchers and the public within a team-based
        environment. My passion resides in research and editing. In my free time, I enjoy hiking,
        reading, and writing.`,

    description: `The 1Cademy Librarian community supports the information processes of all the communities on the 1Cademy platform. We do this by liaising with the co-leaders and interns from each community to help them develop their area of the map and information literacy skills. This work supports communities across all fields of focus in three ways:
    1) Embedded Liaison: We work directly with other communities and attend meetings to help create, edit, and arrange their content
    2) Asynchronous Support: We review a portion of a community's map during Librarian meetings
    3) Consultations: We give feedback directly to co-leaders of other communities when they attend our weekly meetings
    Through each of these efforts communities receive the support they need to locate, interpret, abstract, disseminate, and organize knowledge clearly, comprehensively, and accurately on the 1Cademy Platform.
