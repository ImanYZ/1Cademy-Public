    description: `The 1Cademy AI Assistant is aware of your dynamically changing schedule. When scheduling a one-to-one or group meeting, you simply provide the contact information of the individuals you wish to meet with. The assistant automatically contacts them, and requests that they specify their preferred time slots on a visual calendar of your availabilities, without disclosing any of your tasks or events to them. The assistant also sends reminders to the invitees in case they miss the original invitation. Once the invitees have specified their availabilities, the assistant identifies the most suitable time slots that work for the majority, sets it in your calendar, and sends out Google Calendar invitations to all the attendees. Furthermore, for both one-time and recurring meetings, the assistant can schedule a Google Meet or Zoom call based on your preference. Additionally, the assistant can attend the meeting, transcribe the conversation, and send out a report of the main topics discussed and the results of brainstorming to all the participants after the meeting.`,
