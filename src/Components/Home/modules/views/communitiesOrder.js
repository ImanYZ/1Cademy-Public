        about: `As the writer and director of a musical revue for kindergarteners during the coronavirus pandemic, I expanded my creativity, problem-solving skills, and my patience. The successful performance and smiles on the childrenâ€™s faces made everything worth it.
        I am passionate about helping others, particularly children, in any way I can. Currently, I volunteer my time to give alto saxophone lessons to middle schoolers nearby.
        Freshman year, I conducted my own research project investigating how teachers' beliefs about math development impacted their time teaching math. I became efficient at consolidating datasets and summarizing key variable statistics. I also gained experience in data collection, data imputation, and data organization.
        I am excited for the opportunities that the future holds.`,
