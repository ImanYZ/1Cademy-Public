        about: `As the writer and director of a musical revue for kindergarteners during the coronavirus pandemic, I expanded my creativity, problem-solving skills, and my patience. The successful performance and smiles on the childrenâ€™s faces made everything worth it.
        I am passionate about helping others, particularly children, in any way I can. Currently, I volunteer my time to give alto saxophone lessons to middle schoolers nearby.
        Freshman year, I conducted my own research project investigating how teachers' beliefs about math development impacted their time teaching math. I became efficient at consolidating datasets and summarizing key variable statistics. I also gained experience in data collection, data imputation, and data organization.
        I am excited for the opportunities that the future holds.`,

    description: `The Organizational/Educational Psychology community explores research on both the study of psychology in academia and the psychology utilized in productivity and task management. By using 1Cademy, interns learn how to break down articles into granular concepts, connect them within a larger context of research, communicate their findings to other community interns, and utilize information to write research studies. We value collaborative learning, and expect interns to participate in group discussions both to dive deeper into the content and regularly improve their own content.`,
    accomplishments: `We have explored topics such as: desirable difficulties, gender gap and Matthew effect in education, procrastination, collective intelligence, motivation, microtasking, and citizen science. We have summarized information from many academic research journals on our community topics, but we also allow interns to find specific topics that interest them, and encourage them to expand the map in that area.`,
    requirements: `In addition to the 1Cademy general application process, we require our interns to submit both their most current resume and the most current version of their university transcripts, with GPA included on those transcripts. We require our interns to have a minimum of a 3.5/4.0 GPA to apply for this position. Interns are required to have a degree path in psychology, education, or a related field.`,
