    name: "Developing Learning Pathways",
    body: "Whatever topic one wants to learn is explained somewhere on the Web, but we still pay for textbooks and courses because they provide us with learning pathways (i.e. step-by-step procedures to achieve our learning objectives.) However, textbooks and courses have only a few authors, and they are difficult to update/improve. 1Cademy provides a platform for students, instructors, and researchers to collaboratively design learning pathways on every topic on a single shared knowledge graph. So, we collaboratively author a single textbook (knowledge graph) where one can start learning every topic by going step-by-step backwards through its prerequisite links.",

  {
    name: "Learning Like Researchers",
    body: "1Cademy helps us to start learning from advanced topics and go backwards through the prerequisites as needed! This is how researchers start learning new topics, they specify targets and only learn those prerequisites that are necessary to learn them achieve their objectives.",

    name: "Effective Ways to Learn",
    body: "Whoever finds an easier way to define/explain a concept, they propose it on 1Cademy and the community decides which method is more effective to learn each concept. This way over time, learning through 1Cademy gets more effective and enjoyable.",

    name: "Learning Deeply",
    body: "The process of thinking through the prerequisites of each concept to add it to 1Cademy deepens our learning and helps us discover learning pathways to learn complex concepts that we never thought of.",

    name: "Crowdsourced",
    body: "1Cademy is developed through a large-scale collaboration, like Wikipedia, but while Wikipedia is the most comprehensive encyclopedia, 1Cademy aims to harness the collective intelligence to idenitify learning pathways to learn any topic through identifying the most effective prerequisite links.",

    name: "Research Communities",
    body: "Communities of entusiasts of scientific topics emerge on 1Cademy who are from a large diversity of schools and research institutions, and share what they find helpful on 1Cademy and meet on a weekly basis to discuss their topics of interest. We learn about state-of-the-art topics that our collaborators research at their institutions and find connections that help us form new research groups.",

  {
    name: "Learning Through Teaching",
    body: "Abundant research in cognitive psychology shows that learning with an expectation to teach others is more effective than learning to be tested. We summarize and visualize our learning pathways on 1Cademy for the purpose of improving the effectiveness of our collaborators' learning.",
