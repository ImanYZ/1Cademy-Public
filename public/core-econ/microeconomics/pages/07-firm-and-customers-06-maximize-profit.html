          </h2>
          <p class="keep-together keep-with-next">
            Like the producer of Cheerios, Beautiful Cars will choose its price, <em>P</em>, and quantity, <em>Q</em>,
            taking into account its demand curve and production costs. The demand curve determines the feasible set of
            combinations of <em>P</em> and <em>Q</em>. To find the profit-maximizing point, we can draw the isoprofit
            curves, and find the point of tangency as before.
          </p>
          <p>
            The firm’s profit is the difference between its revenue (the price multiplied by quantity sold) and its
            total costs, <em>C</em>(<em>Q</em>):
          </p>
          \[\begin{align*} \text{profit} &amp;= \text{total revenue} - \text{total costs} \\ &amp;= PQ - C(Q)
          \end{align*}\]
          <dl class="definition non-printing">
            <dt class="definition-term">profit, economic profit</dt>
            <dd class="definition-description">
              A firm’s profit is its revenue minus its total costs. We often refer to profit as ‘economic profit’ to
              emphasise that costs include the opportunity cost of capital (which is not included in ‘accounting
              profit’).
            </dd>
          </dl>
          <dl class="definition">
            <dt class="definition-term">normal profits</dt>
            <dd class="definition-description">
              Normal profits are the returns on investment that the firm must pay to the shareholders to induce them to
              hold shares. The normal profit rate is equal to the opportunity cost of capital and is included in the
              firm’s costs. Any additional profit (revenue greater than costs) is called economic profit. A firm making
              normal profits is making zero economic profit.
            </dd>
          </dl>
          <!--index:
profits \\ economic
profits \\ normal

          <p>
            This calculation gives us what is known as the
            <strong data-term="profit, economic profit">economic profit</strong>. Remember that the return per dollar of
            investment that the firm must pay to shareholders to induce them to hold shares (which is equal to the
            opportunity cost of capital) is included in the firm’s cost function. These payments that must be made to
            shareholders are referred to as <strong data-term="normal profits">normal profits</strong>. Economic profit
            is additional profit above the minimum return required by shareholders.
          </p>
          <p>
            Equivalently, profit (or more specifically, economic profit) is the number of units of output multiplied by
            the profit per unit, which is the difference between the price and the average cost:
          </p>
          \[\begin{align*} \text{profit} &amp;= Q(P-\frac{C(Q)}{Q}) \\ &amp;= Q(P- \text{AC}) \end{align*}\]
          <p>
            In general the shape of the isoprofit curves will depend on the shape of the average cost curve. For
            Beautiful Cars, with cost function \(C(Q) = F + cQ\), we can write profit as:
          </p>
          \[\text{profit} = Q(P-c)-F\]
          <p>
            The equation shows that the isoprofit curves for Beautiful Cars will have the same shape as the ones we drew
            in
            <a href="/core-econ/07-firm-and-customers-02-breakfast-cereal.html#figure-7-2b" class="show-page-number"
              >Figure 7.2b</a
            >
            for Apple Cinnamon Cheerios. Both firms have constant (although different) marginal costs: $2 for a pound of
            Cheerios; $14,400 for a car. The main difference is that Beautiful Cars also has fixed costs, which affect
            the amount of profit on each isoprofit curve.
          </p>
          <p>
            Figure 7.14 shows the isoprofit curves for Beautiful Cars. The lowest curve shown is the horizontal straight
            line where the price is equal to the marginal cost, <em>P</em> = $14,400. At this price the firm makes a
            loss equal to the fixed cost, $80,000. The next curve is the zero-economic-profit curve, which is also the
            average cost curve: the combinations of price and quantity for which economic profit is equal to zero,
            because the price is just equal to the average cost at each quantity. On the higher curves, economic profit
            is positive.

            Isoprofit curves are steep when price is high, and flatter when price is close to marginal cost. At any
            point on an isoprofit curve the slope is given by:
          </p>
          \[\text{slope of isoprofit curve} = -\frac{(P- \text{MC})}{Q}\]
          <p>
            To understand why, think again about point G in Figure 7.14 where <em>Q</em> = 11, and the price is much
            higher than the marginal cost. If you:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>increase <em>Q</em> by 1</li>
            <li>reduce <em>P</em> by (<em>P</em> − <em>c</em>)/<em>Q</em></li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            then your profit will stay the same because the extra profit of (<em>P</em> − <em>c</em>) on car 12 will be
            offset by a fall in revenue of (<em>P</em> − <em>c</em>) on the other 11 cars.
          </p>
          <p>
            Figure 7.15 shows the profit-maximizing choice of price and quantity for Beautiful Cars. Its feasible set is
            all points on or below the demand curve. It obtains the highest profit at E, where the demand curve is
            tangent to an isoprofit curve.

            Remember that the slope of the isoprofit curve depends on (<em>P</em> − <em>c</em>), the difference between
            price and marginal cost, which we call the <strong data-term="profit margin">profit margin</strong>. At
            point E, the profit margin is the additional profit the firm makes by producing and selling the 32nd car.
            Remember also that the slope of the demand curve is related to the price elasticity of demand,
            \(\varepsilon\): \(\varepsilon=-\frac{P}{Q } \times \text{slope}\), or equivalently
            \(\text{slope}=-\frac{P}{\varepsilon Q}\).

            The table in Figure 7.16 shows that the tangency condition MRS = MRT tells us something important: when the
            firm maximizes profit, it sets its price so that the
            <strong data-term="price markup">price markup</strong> (the profit margin as a proportion of the price) is
            equal to the inverse of the elasticity of its demand curve.

            When the intensity of competition from other firms is low, \(\varepsilon\) will be low too. This result
            tells us that the firm will then set a higher price markup than it would if it faced more competition.

          <h3 id="profit-maximization-and-fixed-costs">Profit maximization and fixed costs</h3>
          <p>
            How do the firm’s fixed costs affect its choice of price and quantity? The answer may surprise you: if the
            fixed costs changed, the profit-maximizing choice would not.
          </p>
          <p>
            Suppose Beautiful Cars’ fixed costs increase by $1,000, while the marginal cost remains the same. Remember
            that \(\text{profit} = (P - c)Q - F\). Then if two different (<em>P</em>, <em>Q</em>) combinations were
            equally profitable before, they still give the same amount of profit as each other, although it is $1,000
            lower.
          </p>
          <p class="loosen-15">
            So all the isoprofit curves in
            <a href="/core-econ/07-firm-and-customers-06-maximize-profit.html#figure-7-15">Figure 7.15</a> remain in
            exactly the same places. The only difference is that we need to relabel them to reduce the profit on each
            one by $1,000. The firm makes the same choice of <em>P</em> and <em>Q</em>, but receives $1,000 less profit.

            Using marginal revenue and marginal cost to find the profit-maximizing quantity
          </h3>
          <p>
            In <a href="/core-econ/07-firm-and-customers-06-maximize-profit.html#figure-7-15">Figure 7.15</a> we worked
            out how the firm would maximize profit by finding the values of <em>P</em> and <em>Q</em> that would achieve
            the highest profit within the feasible set. An alternative approach is to work out how profit varies with
            <em>Q</em>, allowing for the effect of changing <em>Q</em> on the price at which cars can be sold.
          </p>
          <p>
            Remember that profit is the difference between revenue and costs, so for any value of <em>Q</em>, the change
            in profit if <em>Q</em> is increased by one unit (marginal profit) will be the difference between the change
            in revenue (marginal revenue, MR), and the change in costs (marginal cost, MC):
          </p>
          \[\begin{align*} \text{profit} &amp;= \text{total revenue} - \text{total costs} \\ \text{marginal profit}
          &amp;= \text{MR} - \text{MC} \end{align*}\]
          <ul>
            <li>If MR &gt; MC, the firm could increase profit by raising <em>Q</em>.</li>
            <li>If MR &lt; MC, the marginal profit is negative. It would be better to decrease <em>Q</em>.</li>
            <li>So at the profit-maximizing <em>Q</em>, MR = MC.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Figure 7.17 shows you how to calculate the marginal revenue for each value of <em>Q</em> along the demand
            curve, and use it to find the point of maximum profit for Beautiful Cars. Remember that Beautiful Cars has
            constant marginal cost; the horizontal line at $14,400 represents MC.

            The marginal revenue curve is usually (although not necessarily) a downward-sloping line. Figure 7.17
            demonstrates that MR = MC at point E′, where <em>Q</em> = 32. The diagram shows the following:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              When <em>Q</em> &lt; 32, MR &gt; MC: so marginal profit is positive; profit increases with <em>Q</em>.
            </li>
            <li>When <em>Q</em> &gt; 32, MR &lt; MC: marginal profit is negative; profit decreases with <em>Q</em>.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            So the firm would not want to choose any <em>Q</em> below 32, because profit could be increased by choosing
            a higher value. And it would not want any <em>Q</em> above 32 because profit is decreasing: it would be
            better to choose a lower value.
          </p>
          <p>
            The profit-maximizing quantity is <em>Q</em> = 32. What should the price be? To maximize profit, the firm
            should set the highest price at which 32 cars can be sold, according to the demand curve. So profit is
            maximized at point E: <em>Q</em> = 32, and <em>P</em> = $27,200.
          </p>
          <p>
            Figure 7.18 shows that point E′, where MR = MC, leads us to the same profit-maximizing point that we found
            before by finding a tangency point.

                depicts the demand curve for Beautiful Cars, together with the marginal cost and isoprofit curves. At
                point E, the quantity–price combination is (<em>Q</em>*, <em>P</em>*) = (32, 27,200) and the profit is
                $329,600.
              </p>
              <p class="loosen-10">
                Suppose that the firm chooses instead to produce <em>Q</em> = 32 cars and sets the price at <em>P</em> =
                $27,000. Using this information, read the following statements and choose the correct option(s).
              </p>
              <ul class="mcq-options">
                <li>The profit remains the same at $329,600.</li>

                <li>The average cost of production is $17,000.</li>
                <li>The firm is unable to sell all the cars.</li>

              <ul class="mcq-feedback">
                <li>
                  Since <em>Q</em> is still 32, production costs remain the same, but revenue falls, so profit falls.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Since <em>Q</em> is still 32, production costs remain the same. Revenue falls by $200 on each car, so
                  by $6,400 in total. So profit is $329,600 – $6,400 = $323,200.
                </li>
                <li>
                  At E, where <em>Q</em>* = 32 and <em>P</em>* = $27,200, the profit is $329,600. So the profit per car
                  is $329,600/32 = $10,300. Since $27,200 – AC = $10,300, AC must be $16,900.
                </li>
                <li>
                  At the lower price the demand is higher than 32, so the firm will have no problem selling all 32 cars
                  at the new price.

                In the main part of this section, we used diagrams to show how a firm (Beautiful Cars) would set its
                profit-maximizing price and quantity. We took two different approaches: one involving isoprofit curves
                and another involving marginal revenue and marginal costs. In this extension, we show how to do this
                mathematically, <em>using calculus</em> (differentiation). In particular, we apply the method for
                solving constrained choice problems, which is explained in

              We have found the profit-maximizing price and quantity diagrammatically, in two ways: first by drawing
              isoprofit curves and finding the point of tangency with the demand curve, and secondly by drawing the MR
              and MC curves. In this extension, we demonstrate how to do this mathematically, using calculus.

              Beautiful Cars has linear demand and cost functions; marginal cost is constant ($14,400) and fixed cost is
              $80,000. Figure E7.2 (taken from Figure 7.15) shows the isoprofit curves and profit-maximizing point (E)
              for this case.

              As in Extensions 7.4 and 7.5, we will examine the more general case of a firm with cost function,
              \(C(Q)\), and inverse demand function, \(P=f(Q)\). Remember that the average and marginal cost functions
              are:
            </p>
            \[\text{AC}(Q)=\frac{C(Q)}{Q} \text{ and } \text{MC}(Q)=C'(Q)\]
            <div class="sidenote">
              <p>The symbol Π is the Greek capital letter ‘pi’, and is often used in economics to represent profit.</p>
            </div>
            <p>The firm’s profit, which we call \(\Pi\), is a function of \(P\) and \(Q\):</p>
            \[\Pi (P, Q) = PQ - C(Q)\]
            <h3 id="drawing-isoprofit-curves-and-calculating-their-slopes">
              Drawing isoprofit curves and calculating their slopes
            </h3>
            <p>
              The isoprofit curves are a family of curves in the \(Q–P\) plane, each of which corresponds to a given
              level of profit. The equation of a typical isoprofit curve is:
            </p>
            \[PQ - C(Q) = \Pi_0\]
            <p>
              where \(\Pi_0\) is a constant that represents the level of profit. There is a different curve for each
              value of \(\Pi_0\).
            </p>
            <p>
              We can work out the shape of the isoprofit curves by examining the algebraic properties of this equation.
              To represent them in a diagram with \(P\) on the vertical axis, it is helpful to rearrange this equation
              to express \(P\) as a function of \(Q\):
            </p>
            \[P = \frac{C(Q)+\Pi_0}{Q}\]
            <p>
              This equation implies that if \(\Pi_0\) increases, then \(P\) also increases for any given \(Q\). So in a
              diagram depicting the family of isoprofit curves, higher curves correspond to higher levels of profit.
              Also, the zero-profit curve (\(\Pi_0=0\)) corresponds to the average cost curve, \(C(Q)/Q\): the firm
              makes a profit of zero when its price is equal to the average cost of a unit of output.
            </p>
            <p>
              To find the slope of an isoprofit curve at any point, we can differentiate using the rule for a quotient:
            </p>
            \[\frac{dP}{dQ}= -\frac{QC'(Q)-(C(Q)+\Pi_0)}{Q^2}\]
            <p>And since \(C(Q)+\Pi_0=PQ\), we have:</p>
            \[\frac{dP}{dQ} = \frac{C'(Q)-P}{Q}=\frac{\text{MC}-P}{Q}\]
            <p>
              This is the result we obtained in the main part of this section for Beautiful Cars. In that case,
              \(\text{MC}=c\), a constant. Figure E7.2 shows that the isoprofit curve where \(P=c\) is flat, and that
              all the curves above it, where \(P&gt;c\), slope downward.
            </p>
            <p>
              For cost functions where MC is not constant, isoprofit curves may slope upward for some values of \(P\)
              and \(Q\), and downward for others—as the following example illustrates.
            </p>
            <h4 id="example">Example</h4>
            <p>
              Figure E7.3 shows the isoprofit curves for a quadratic cost curve, \(C(Q)=320+2Q+0.2Q^2\). The equations
              of the marginal cost and isoprofit curves are as follows:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Marginal cost: \(\text{MC}(Q)=C'(Q)=2+0.4Q\)</li>
              <li>Isoprofit curve: \(P=\frac{320+\Pi_0}{Q}+2+0.2Q\)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              This firm has fixed costs of 320, and its marginal cost increases with output—MC is an upward-sloping
              line. We have plotted MC, together with the isoprofit curve for \(\Pi_0=0\) (the AC curve), and the curves
              for \(\Pi_0=310\) and \(640\).

              Figure E7.3 shows that the isoprofit curves slope downward in the areas of the diagram where \(P &gt;
              \text{MC}\), and upward where \(P &lt; \text{MC}\). We have already shown in Extension 7.4 that if the AC
              curve is U-shaped, the MC curve crosses it at the point where AC is minimized. Now we know that on any
              isoprofit curve, MC crosses at the point with lowest value of \(P\).

              The owners of the firm want to choose their price and quantity from the feasible set to make the highest
              possible profit, \(\Pi=PQ-C(Q)\). The feasible combinations of \(P\) and \(Q\) lie on or below the demand
              curve, \(P=f(Q)\). A point above the demand curve would not be feasible because the price would be too
              high for it to sell the corresponding quantity of output. In other words, when choosing \(P\) and \(Q\),
              the firm faces a constraint \(P\leq f(Q)\).

              and \(Q\) that lies on the demand curve, and we can write the constraint as \(P=f(Q)\). Then the

              The simplest mathematical approach to this problem is the method of substitution. We use the constraint to

              To find the value of \(Q\) that maximizes this function, we differentiate with respect to \(Q\), using the
              product rule:
            </p>
            \[\frac{d\Pi}{dQ} = f(Q) + Qf'(Q) - C'(Q)\]
            <p>
              The profit-maximizing quantity, \(Q^*\), satisfies the first-order condition \(d\Pi/dQ = 0\) (where the
              slope of the profit function in Figure E7.4 is zero):
            </p>
            \[f(Q)+Qf '(Q)= C'(Q)\]
            <p>
              If we knew the specific form of the functions, \(f(Q)\) and \(C(Q)\), we could try to solve the equation
              to find \(Q^*\) explicitly. The profit-maximizing price could then be calculated: \(P^*=f(Q^*)\).
            </p>
            <p>
              But without knowing the functions, we can still consider what the first-order condition tells us. Since
              the profit-maximizing value of \(Q\) is on the demand curve, \(f(Q) = P\) and the first-order condition
              can be written as:
            </p>
            \[f'(Q)= \frac{C'(Q) - P}{Q}\]
            <p>
              The left-hand side of this equation is the slope of the demand curve, and (from above) the right-hand side
              is the slope of the isoprofit curve. Therefore, the first-order condition tells us precisely that the
              profit-maximizing choice lies at a point of tangency between the demand and isoprofit curves.
            </p>
            <p>
              The first-order condition also gives us the relationship between the price markup and the demand
              elasticity at the profit-maximizing point. Rearranging the first-order condition:
            </p>
            \[P-C'(Q)=-Qf'(Q)\]
            <p>
              and using the formula for the elasticity in terms of the inverse demand function,
              \(\varepsilon=-\dfrac{f(Q)}{Qf'(Q)}=-\dfrac{P}{Qf'(Q)}\), we get:
            </p>
            \[\frac{P-C'(Q)}{P}=\frac{1}{\varepsilon}\]
            <p>
              That is, the markup of price over marginal cost is equal to the inverse of the price elasticity of demand.
            </p>
            <h4 id="example-1">Example</h4>
            <p>
              Consider again the firm with cost curve is \(C(Q)=320+2Q+0.2Q^2\), and suppose its inverse demand function
              is \(P=44-0.5Q\). Substituting for \(P\), we can write profit in terms of \(Q\) only and differentiate to
              obtain the first-order condition:
            </p>
            \[\begin{align*} \Pi&amp;=Q(44-0.5Q)-(320+2Q+0.2Q^2)\\\frac{d\Pi}{dQ} &amp;= 42-1.4Q=0 \\ \text{and hence }
            Q^*&amp;=30 \end{align*}\]
            <p>
              So the profit-maximizing quantity is \(Q^*=30\) and the corresponding price from the demand curve is
              \(P^*= 44-0.5Q^*=29\). Figure E7.5 shows the solution graphically.

              The slope of the inverse demand function is −0.5, and we can verify that the slope of the isoprofit curve
              at \((Q^*, P^*)\) is also −0.5:
            </p>
            \[\begin {align*} \text{slope of isoprofit} &amp;= \frac{C'(Q)-P}{Q}\\&amp;=\frac{2+0.4Q^* -
            P^*}{Q^*}\\&amp;=\frac{2+0.4\times 30-29}{30}=-0.5 \end {align*}\]
            <p>
              Since demand curves always slope downward, the profit-maximizing point will always be at a point where the
              isoprofit curve slopes downward. Hence, the firm sets a price that exceeds marginal cost.
            </p>
            <h4 id="the-condition-mr--mc">The condition \(MR = MC\)</h4>
            <p>
              The main part of the section shows that the profit-maximizing quantity can be found diagrammatically at
              the point where marginal revenue is equal to marginal cost.
            </p>
            <p>
              To derive this algebraically, we write the firm’s revenue, \(R=PQ\), in terms of \(Q\) only using the
              inverse demand function, \(P=f(Q)\). The revenue function is:
            </p>
            \[R(Q)=Qf(Q)\]
            <p>and the marginal revenue, MR, is given by:</p>
            \[MR=R'(Q)=f(Q)+Qf'(Q)\]
            <p>So the first-order condition for profit maximization is exactly equivalent to the condition, MR = MC:</p>
            \[\begin{align*} f(Q)+Qf'(Q)&amp;=C'(Q)\\ \text{MR}&amp;=\text{MC} \end{align*}\]
            <p>
              Since profit is equal to revenue minus cost (\(\Pi(Q)= R(Q)-C(Q)\)) you can solve a profit maximization
              problem either by differentiating the profit function and solving the equation \(\Pi'(Q)=0\), or by
              finding MR and MC by differentiating the revenue and cost functions and solving the equation, MR = MC.
              Both approaches give you the same answer.
