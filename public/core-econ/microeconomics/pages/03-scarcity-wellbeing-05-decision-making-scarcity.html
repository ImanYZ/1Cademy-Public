<p class="keep-with-next keep-together">We have described Karim’s preferences for different combinations of consumption and free time, and worked out which combinations are feasible for him. The third step in modelling decision-making about hours of work is to bring the decision-maker’s preferences and feasible set together, to determine the combination of consumption and free time that will be chosen. Figure 3.7a brings together Karim’s feasible frontier (<a href="/core-econ/03-scarcity-wellbeing-04-feasible-set.html#figure-3-6" class="show-page-number">Figure 3.6</a>) and indifference curves (<a href="/core-econ/03-scarcity-wellbeing-03-goods-and-preferences.html#figure-3-4" class="show-page-number">Figure 3.4</a>). Recall that the indifference curves indicate what Karim prefers, and their slopes show the trade-offs that he is willing to make; the feasible frontier is the constraint on his choice, and its slope shows the trade-off he is constrained to make.</p>
<p>Figure 3.7a shows four indifference curves, labelled IC<sub>1</sub> to IC<sub>4</sub>. IC<sub>4</sub> represents the highest level of utility because it is the furthest away from the origin. No combination of consumption and free time on IC<sub>4</sub> is feasible, however, because the whole indifference curve lies outside the feasible set. Suppose that Karim considers choosing a combination somewhere in the feasible set, on IC<sub>1</sub>. The steps in Figure 3.7a show how he can increase his utility by moving to points on higher indifference curves until he reaches a feasible choice that maximizes his utility.</p>

<p class="tighten-5">In Figure 3.7a, Karim reaches the highest attainable indifference curve at E: the point on the feasible frontier where the indifference curve and the feasible frontier have the same slope. Now, remember that the slopes represent the two trade-offs facing Karim:</p>

  <li><em>The slope of the frontier represents the MRT</em>: It is the trade-off that he is constrained to make between free time and consumption because it is not possible to go beyond the feasible frontier.</li>

At B and D, the amount of consumption Karim is willing to trade for an hour of free time (MRS) is greater than the amount he would have to trade (MRT), so he prefers to increase his free time. At A, the MRT is greater than the MRS, so he prefers to decrease his free time. And, as expected, at E the MRS and MRT are equal.</p>

<p>We have modelled Karim’s decision on working hours as what we call a <strong data-term="constrained choice problem">constrained choice problem</strong>: a decision-maker (Karim) pursues an objective (utility maximization, in this case) subject to a constraint (his feasible frontier).</p>
<p class="keep-with-next">In our example, both free time and consumption are scarce for Karim because:</p>
<ul>
  <li><em>Free time and consumption are goods</em>: Karim values both of them.</li>
  <li><em>Each has an opportunity cost</em>: More of one good means less of the other.</li>
</ul>

  <ol>
    <li>Using the diagram of the feasible set from Exercise 3.3, sketch indifference curves to show her preferences for the two goods, assuming they have a similar shape to Karim’s (downward-sloping and becoming flatter as free time increases). Explain why it is reasonable to assume that Zoë’s indifference curves also have this shape (Hint: think about how the MRS changes as you move along an indifference curve.) Can you think of any reason why they might have a different shape (for example, straight lines, or curves that become steeper as the good on the horizontal axis increases)?</li>

  <div class="extension-preview">
    <p>Constrained choice problems arise in many economic models. Although diagrams can help us understand them, as they do in the main part of this section, solving them mathematically gives us additional insight, and also helps to ensure that we are not misled by the particular way we draw a diagram. In this extension, we describe two methods for solving them <em>using calculus</em>. One uses the analysis and economic insight from Extensions 3.3 and 3.4; the other is a mathematical substitution method that can sometimes be used for constrained choice problems.</p>
  </div>
  <p>Karim wants as much consumption as possible while sacrificing the least possible amount of free time. This is shown diagrammatically in Figure 3.7a (reproduced here as Figure E3.3): he maximizes his utility by choosing point E where an indifference curve is tangential to the feasible frontier. At point E, his marginal rate of substitution (MRS) is equal to his marginal rate of transformation (MRT). In this extension, we show how to formulate Karim’s decision mathematically as a constrained choice problem, and solve it to find his best combination of consumption and free time.</p>

  <p>Karim’s utility function (the one shown in Figure E3.3) is</p>
\[u(t,c)=(t-6)^2(c-45) \text{ for } t&gt;6, c&gt;45\]
  <p>and the equation of the feasible frontier (his budget constraint) is \(c= w(24-t)\), where \(w\) is the wage (equal to $30 in Figure E3.3).</p>
  <div class="info">
    <h3 id="karims-constrained-choice-problem">Karim’s constrained choice problem</h3>
    <p>Choose \(t\) and \(c\) to maximize \(u(t, c)\) subject to the constraint, \(c=w(24\ –\ t)\).</p>
  </div>
  <p>In constrained choice problems, the function we want to maximize (or in some problems minimize) is called the ‘objective function’. Karim’s objective is to maximize his utility.</p>
  <p>Sometimes in this sort of problem, the constraint is written as an inequality: \(c \leq w(24\ –\ t)\), which can be interpreted as saying that his choice must lie in the feasible set. But because his utility depends positively on \(t\) and \(c\), we know that he will want to choose a point on the frontier. So we can write the constraint as an equation, which makes the problem easier to solve mathematically.</p>
  <h3 id="two-methods-for-solving-karims-constrained-choice-problem">Two methods for solving Karim’s constrained choice problem</h3>
  <p>One way to solve Karim’s problem is to use the constraint to substitute for \(c\) in terms of \(t\) in the utility function, so that utility is expressed as a function of the single variable \(t\):</p>
\[u = (t-6)^2(w(24-t)-45)\]
  <p>Then we can maximize this expression with respect to \(t\) by equating its derivative to zero. Using the product rule for differentiation:</p>
\[\begin{align}
\frac{du}{dt} = 2(t - 6)(w (24 - t) - 45) - w (t - 6)^{2} &amp;= 0 \\
\Rightarrow 2(w(24 - t) - 45) &amp;= w(t - 6)
\end{align}\]
  <p>Rearranging to solve this equation for \(t\), we obtain:</p>
\[t=18-\frac{30}{w}\]
  <p>In the case when \(w=30\), this gives ­us \(t=17\), and we can substitute back into the budget constraint to determine the corresponding level of consumption: \(c = 30(24-17) = 210\).</p>
  <p>To check that we have found a maximum point (rather than a minimum or a point of inflection) we should consider the sign of the second derivative \(d^2u/dt^2\) at this point. Differentiating the expression above for \(du/dt\), you can check that \(d^2u/dt^2=90(23-2t)\), which is negative when \(t=17\)<em>—</em>so this is indeed a maximum.</p>
  <p>In summary, to maximize his utility subject to the budget constraint, Karim should choose to take 17 hours of free time, and work for 7 hours, obtaining consumption of $210. This is point E in Figure E3.3.</p>
  <p>An alternative method is to apply what we know about the solution from drawing indifference curves and the budget constraint. That is, the best combination of \(c\) and \(t\) for Karim is at the tangency point of the budget constraint and an indifference curve. So it satisfies two conditions:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>It is on the budget constraint.</li>
    <li>It is at a point where \(\text{MRS}=\text{MRT}\).</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We know from Extension 3.3 that the MRS is equal to the ratio of the marginal utilities, \(\frac{\partial u}{\partial t}/\frac{\partial u}{\partial c}\):</p>
\[\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} = 2(t-6)(c-45) \ \text{and} \ \frac{\partial u}{\partial c} = (t-6)^2 \Rightarrow \text{MRT} = \frac{2(c-45)}{(t-6)}\]
  <p>and from Extension 3.4 that the MRT is \(w\). So the two conditions satisfied by Karin’s best combination are:</p>
\[c = w(24-t)\]
\[\frac{2(c-45)}{(t-6)} = w\]
  <p>This gives us a pair of simultaneous equations for \(t\) and \(c\). The easiest way to solve them is to use the first equation to substitute for \(c\) in the second. You can check that this gives us the same equation for \(t\) that we obtained using the first method.</p>
  <h3 id="the-first-order-condition">The first-order condition</h3>
  <p>You will encounter many other examples of constrained choice problems in economic models. Typically, we find the solution at a point on the constraint that satisfies a condition known as the ‘first-order condition’.</p>
  <p>In Karim’s problem the solution is on the budget constraint, and satisfies the first-order condition MRS = MRT. It is described as ‘first-order’ because it involves first derivatives. Using the substitution method, we obtained the first-order condition by setting the first derivative of the objective function to zero.</p>
  <p>Note that when we used the substitution method, we also checked the ‘second-order condition’: we checked that we had found a maximum point using the second derivative of the objective function. We didn’t check the second-order condition for the other method, because there we were using our economic understanding of the problem (helped by a diagram) to deduce that the tangency point must be the maximum.</p>

    <h3 id="exercise-e34-solving-the-constrained-problem-using-two-methods"><strong>Exercise E3.4</strong> Solving the constrained problem using two methods</h3>
    <p>Karim’s friend has the utility function \(u(t,c)=t^{3}c\) and faces an hourly wage of $25.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Assuming that Karim’s friend wants to maximize utility, use the substitution method to find how many hours of free time (\(t\)) he would choose, and the corresponding amount he can consume (\(c\)).</li>
      <li>Verify that you obtain the same answer using the MRS = MRT method.</li>
      <li>Using the general expressions \(u(t,c)=t^a c^b\) and \(c=w(24-t)\), show that the substitution method and the MRS = MRT methods obtain the same result.</li>
