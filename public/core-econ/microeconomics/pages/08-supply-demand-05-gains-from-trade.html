<p class="keep-with-next keep-together">Buyers and sellers of bread voluntarily engage in trade because both benefit. The <strong data-term="gains from trade, gains from exchange">gains from trade</strong> can be measured in the same way as in <a href="/core-econ/07-firm-and-customers-07-divided-surplus.html" class="show-page-number">Unit 7</a>, by the surpluses obtained by buyers and sellers. There is a potential surplus whenever a buyer will pay more for a loaf than the marginal cost of producing it.</p>
<p>Figure 8.12 shows the market supply and demand curves for bread. Remember that bakeries differ in their marginal costs of producing bread, and the supply curve tells us the marginal cost of each loaf produced. The demand curve shows the consumers’ willingness to pay. For every loaf up to the 5,000th one produced, there is a consumer who is willing to pay more than the marginal cost of producing it.</p>
<p>In the competitive equilibrium at point A, 5,000 loaves are sold at €2 each. All consumers up to the 5,000th receive a monetary surplus equal to their WTP minus the price; and producers of all loaves up to the 5,000th receive a surplus equal to the price minus the marginal cost of producing the loaf.</p>

  <li>If fewer loaves were produced, there would be unexploited gains from trade: some consumers without bread would be willing to pay more than the cost of producing another loaf.</li>
  <li>If any more than 5,000 loaves were produced, the total surplus would decrease, because the surplus on the extra loaves would be negative: they would cost more to make than consumers would pay.</li>
  <li>At the equilibrium, the marginal cost of the last loaf produced—the 5,000th—is equal to the willingness to pay of the last consumer who buys, so all potential gains from trade are exploited.</li>

It contrasts with the allocation of a differentiated good (<a href="/core-econ/07-firm-and-customers-07-divided-surplus.html#figure-7-20" class="show-page-number">Figure 7.20</a>), where there is a deadweight loss because the producer sets a price above the marginal cost of the last item produced.</p>

<p>Since all potential gains from trade are exploited at the competitive equilibrium, we know that it is not possible to change the allocation (the amount of bread produced, and who buys and sells it) to make a consumer or firm better off without making any of them worse off.</p>

<p>Does this mean the equilibrium allocation is <strong data-term="Pareto efficient, Pareto efficiency">Pareto efficient</strong>? The answer is yes, provided that no one other than the consumers and bakeries is affected by trade in the bread market. But if, for example, producing bread involved a lot of noise or pollution which affected the people living nearby, then to find a Pareto efficient allocation, we would have to allow for these additional costs of bread production (known as <strong data-term="external effect, externality">external effects</strong>).</p>
<p>The Pareto efficiency of a competitive equilibrium allocation is often interpreted as a powerful argument in favour of markets as a means of allocating resources. But we should be careful not to exaggerate the value of this theoretical result. It holds only under the following stringent conditions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>In a market with many buyers and sellers of identical goods</li>
  <li>At the equilibrium, when all participants are price-takers</li>

<p>The fourth condition can be assumed to hold in our example: the exchange of a loaf of bread for money is governed by a complete contract. If you find there is no loaf of bread in the bag marked ‘bread’ when you get home, you can get your money back. But in other cases, it may be impossible to ensure that all the important aspects of the exchange are covered by a legally enforceable contract.</p>
<p class="keep-with-next">In practice:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Most firms sell goods that are somehow differentiated from those of other firms—even bakeries selling identical loaves differ in location, and the service and range of goods they offer.</li>
  <li>Evidence of price-taking is hard to find (<a href="/core-econ/08-supply-demand-10-supply-demand-competitive-equilibrium.html" class="show-page-number">Section 8.10</a>).</li>
  <li>Many goods have external effects—such as carbon emissions that contribute to climate change.</li>
  <li>Contracts are often incomplete: for example, the buyer of a second-hand car may not know whether it is reliable and roadworthy.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="the-distribution-of-the-gains-from-trade">The distribution of the gains from trade</h3>
<p>There are two criteria for assessing an allocation: efficiency and fairness (<a href="/core-econ/05-the-rules-of-the-game-03-evaluating-institutions-outcomes.html" class="show-page-number">Unit 5</a>). Even if we think that a market allocation is Pareto efficient, we should not conclude that it is necessarily a desirable one. As we explain in <a href="/core-econ/07-firm-and-customers-07-divided-surplus.html" class="show-page-number">Unit 7</a>, consumer and producer surplus do not tell us about fairness, because the sum of monetary gains is a poor measure of the overall benefits. But we can assess how the monetary gains are distributed between the producers and the consumers, by comparing the consumer and producer surplus. In Figure 8.12, consumer surplus is slightly higher than producer surplus. This happens because the demand curve is relatively steep (inelastic).</p>
<p>Just as we measure the responsiveness of consumers to price changes using the elasticity of demand, we can use the elasticity of supply to measure the responsiveness of producers. In Figure 8.12, demand is less elastic than supply. In general, the distribution of the total surplus between consumers and producers depends on the relative elasticities of demand and supply.</p>

  <h3 id="the-demand-and-supply-functions">The demand and supply functions</h3>
  <p>To determine the gains from trade mathematically, we need to specify the equations of the demand and supply curves. As in other extensions, we treat \(Q\) as a continuous variable so that we can use calculus for this analysis, rather than thinking of \(Q\) as representing discrete numbers of loaves.</p>
  <p>Suppose the demand for bread is described by the inverse demand function, \(P=f(Q)\), where \(P\) is the price and \(Q\) is the quantity of bread. Under the usual assumption that demand curves slope downward (the Law of Demand), \(f\) is a decreasing function: \(f'(Q)&lt;0\).</p>
  <p>We know from Extension 8.4 that the inverse supply curve is the marginal cost curve for bread production in this market. If we let \(C(Q)\) be the total cost (for all the bakeries together) of producing a total quantity, \(Q\), then the marginal cost is \(C'(Q)\), and \(P=C'(Q)\) is the equation of the inverse market supply function. We assume \(C'(Q)\) is positive and increases with \(Q\), so that the supply curve slopes upward, which means that \(C(Q)\) is an increasing, convex function.</p>
  <p>Marginal cost is the derivative of total costs. So, we can find the total cost at quantity, \(Q\), by integrating the marginal cost function. Integrating between quantities 0 and \(Q\), we obtain:</p>
\[C(Q) = C(0)+ \int_0^Q C'(q) \, dq\]
  <p>where \(C(0)\) is the total cost at quantity zero—that is, the fixed costs. This equation tells us that the total cost, \(C(Q)\), is the <em>fixed costs</em> of all firms plus the area under the marginal cost curve for quantities less than or equal to \(Q\), which is the total <em>variable costs</em>.</p>
  <h3 id="calculating-consumer-and-producer-surplus">Calculating consumer and producer surplus</h3>
  <p>Remember that the demand function tells us the willingness to pay (WTP) for bread. If consumers are lined up in order of willingness to pay for a loaf, then the \(q{^t}{^h}\) consumer is willing to pay \(P = f(q)\). Any buyer whose willingness to pay for a good is higher than the price they pay receives a surplus. Suppose that the \(q{^t}{^h}\) consumer pays \(P_0\) for a loaf of bread. Then the surplus of this consumer will be \(f(q) - P_0\). In Figure E8.4, where all consumers pay a price of €2, this is the vertical distance at the quantity, \(q\), between the demand curve and the horizontal line, \(P=2\).</p>
  <dl class="definition">
<dt class="definition-term">consumer surplus</dt><dd class="definition-description">Each consumer who buys a good receives a surplus equal to their willingness to pay minus the price. The term ‘consumer surplus’ normally refers to the sum of these surpluses across all consumers.</dd>
</dl>
  <p>We defined <strong data-term="consumer surplus">consumer surplus</strong> as the sum of the surpluses (in monetary terms) for all the consumers who purchase bread; when quantity \(Q\) is a continuous variable, it is the <em>integral</em> of the surpluses over all these consumers.</p>
  <p>Suppose the price is \(P_0\) and the total quantity sold is \(Q_0\). Figure E8.5 illustrates this situation for the case, \(P_0=2.5, Q_0=3,000\). Then, consumer surplus corresponds to the shaded area between the demand curve and \(P=P_0\). We are assuming that all loaves are sold at the same price, but not that the market is in equilibrium.</p>

  <p>To find the shaded area that represents consumer surplus, we need to integrate the surpluses, \((f(q)-P_0)\), over all values of \(q\) between \(q=0\) and \(q=Q_0\):</p>
\[\mbox{consumer surplus} = \int_0^{Q_0} (f(q) - P_0) \, dq = \int_0^{Q_0} f(q) \, dq - P_0Q_0 = F(Q_0) - P_0Q_0\]
  <p>In this expression, we have introduced the notation, \(F(Q)\), to denote the integral of the function, \(f\). That is, the area under the demand curve for quantities between 0 and \(Q\). By the fundamental theorem of calculus:</p>
\[F'(Q) = f(Q)\]
  <p>We have specified that \(f(Q)\) is a decreasing function, so it follows that function \(F\) is concave.</p>
  <p>Likewise, since the market supply curve corresponds to the marginal costs of loaves of bread in order of increasing marginal cost, the \(q{^t}{^h}\) loaf costs \(C'(q)\) to produce. If the firm is paid \(P_0\) for this loaf, it receives a surplus equal to \(P_0 - C'(q)\). In the diagram, this is the vertical distance at the quantity, \(q\), between the supply curve and the horizontal line, \(P=P_0\).</p>

    <p>As explained in <a href="/core-econ/07-firm-and-customers-07-divided-surplus.html">Section 7.7</a>, producer surplus is the firm’s economic rent relative to the outside option of not producing any output, but still incurring the fixed costs. Profit is the firm’s rent relative to the outside option of leaving the market altogether.</p>

  <p>This expression shows that the producer surplus is equal to the firms’ profits plus their fixed costs. Equivalently, profit equals producer surplus minus fixed costs.</p>
  <h3 id="maximizing-consumer-and-producer-surplus">Maximizing consumer and producer surplus</h3>
  <p>The expressions we have obtained for consumer surplus, \(F(Q_0)-P_0Q_0\), and producer surplus, \(P_0Q_0 - C(Q_0)+C(0)\), give the value of consumer surplus for any price, \(P_0\), and any quantity, \(Q_0\); they apply whether or not the price is at the market-clearing level.</p>
  <p>Since they measure the gains from trade, it is useful to know what conditions make them as large as possible. Continuing to assume that the price is fixed at \(P=P_0\), we will consider how consumer surplus (CS) varies with quantity, \(Q\):</p>
\[\text{CS}(Q) = F(Q) - P_0Q\]
  <p>The value of \(Q\) that maximizes consumer surplus can be found by setting the derivative of CS to zero:</p>
\[F'(Q) = P_0\]
  <p>Note that since \(F(Q)\) is concave, the second derivative of CS is negative, which confirms that this condition gives us a maximum point.</p>
  <p>This equation tells us that if the price is \(P_0\), then CS is maximized when the quantity sold is on the demand curve at \(P_0\)—that is, when all consumers whose willingness to pay is greater than or equal to \(P_0\) participate in the market. If fewer consumers participate (as at \(Q_0\) in Figure E8.5), there are unexploited gains. And if any other consumers bought bread, they would receive a negative surplus, thereby decreasing the aggregate consumer surplus.</p>
  <p>In exactly the same way, you can show that producer surplus,</p>
\[\text{PS}(Q) = P_0Q-C(Q)\]
  <p>is maximized when</p>
\[P_0 =C'(Q)\]
  <p>So whatever the price, producers maximize their surplus if the marginal cost of bread is equal to the price.</p>
  <h3 id="maximizing-total-surplus">Maximizing total surplus</h3>
  <p>The sum of the producer and consumer surplus is the total surplus. When the price is \(P_0\) and the quantity sold is \(Q\), total surplus is \(N(Q)\):</p>
\[\begin{align}
 N(Q) &amp;= F(Q) - P_0 Q + P_0 Q - C(Q)\\
\text{total surplus} &amp;= \text{consumer surplus} +\text{producer surplus} 
\end{align}\]
  <p>which can be simplified to:</p>
\[N(Q) = F(Q) - C(Q)\]
  <p>Note that the total surplus depends only on the quantity sold. Whatever the price, the amount paid for bread is a loss for consumers and an equal gain for firms, so the two cancel out when we add their surpluses together to evaluate the total surplus from the market.</p>
  <p>To find the quantity, \(Q^*\), that maximizes the total surplus, we set the derivative of <em>N</em>(<em>Q</em>) to zero. Then \(Q^*\) is the quantity that satisfies the equation:</p>
\[F'(Q^*) =C'(Q^*)\]
  <p>To be sure that \(Q^*\) maximizes \(N\), we need to consider the second derivative. Remember that \(F\) is concave, and \(C\) is convex. So the second derivative of \(F\) is negative, and the second derivative of \(C\) is positive. We can deduce that the second derivative of \(N\) is negative, and hence that \(Q^*\) corresponds to a maximum point.</p>
  <p>Since \(F'(Q^*) =f(Q^*)\), this equation tells us that \(Q^*\) is at the point where the inverse demand curve, \(P=f(Q)\), meets the inverse supply curve, \(P=C'(Q)\). \(Q^*\) is the level of output at which demand and supply curves cross. This is the level of output achieved when the market is in competitive equilibrium. Therefore, we have proved that in the competitive equilibrium allocation, in which the market clears at the equilibrium price \(P^* = f(Q^*) =C'(Q^*)\), the quantity sold maximizes the total gains from trade.</p>

    <h3 id="exercise-e83-calculating-surplus"><strong>Exercise E8.3</strong> Calculating surplus</h3>
    <p>Suppose the (indirect) market supply function is \(P = 2 + 4Q\) and the (indirect) market demand function is \(P = 80 - 2Q\).</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Find the equilibrium price and quantity, and calculate the corresponding producer and consumer surplus. Draw a diagram to illustrate this outcome.</li>
      <li>Now suppose the market price is fixed at \(P = 44\). Calculate producer and consumer surplus when (i) market quantity is determined by supply, and (ii) market quantity is determined by demand. For both scenarios, use a diagram to indicate these areas of surplus.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Now suppose the (indirect) market supply function is \(P = 0.4Q^2 + Q + 14.7\) and the (indirect) market demand function is \(P = 0.1Q^2 – 8Q + 120\).</p>
    <ol start="3">
      <li>Find the equilibrium price and quantity, and calculate the corresponding producer and consumer surplus. (Hint: Use integration.) Draw a diagram to illustrate this outcome.</li>
