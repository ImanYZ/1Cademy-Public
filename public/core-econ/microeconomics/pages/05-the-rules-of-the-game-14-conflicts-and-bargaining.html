            Bruno and Angela have conflicting interests over hours of work and the distribution of grain. We can apply a
            similar model to cases of conflicting interests about the environment. Conflicts arise because environmental
            quality is never the same for everyone. When greenhouse gases or pollutants degrade an environment, some
            people suffer more than others, depending on their location and income, while some benefit from the economic
            activity that causes the damage.

              An external effect occurs when a person’s action confers a benefit or imposes a cost on others and this
              cost or benefit is not taken into account by the individual taking the action. External effects are also
              called externalities.

            For example, in 2008 and 2009, two oil spills in the Niger delta of Nigeria destroyed fisheries. The spills
            resulted from the oil extraction activities of the Anglo-Dutch company, Royal Dutch Shell. Lawyers for the
            Ogoni people, who suffered these <strong data-term="external effect, externality">external effects</strong>,
            brought a lawsuit against the Nigerian subsidiary of Shell in the British courts.
            <a href="https://tinyco.re/1087343" class="show-url"
              >In 2015, Shell settled out of court and paid £3,525 per person</a
            >, of which £2,200 was paid to each individual, and the rest to support community public goods. This award
            amounted to more than most Ogoni people would earn in a year. Lawyers representing the community helped to
            set up bank accounts for the 15,600 beneficiaries.

            The transfers may have partially compensated the Ogoni for the loss of a healthy environment. (The UN
            Environment Programme has estimated that restoration will cost $1 billion and take 30 years.) For Royal
            Dutch Shell, the settlement requires them to bear at least some cost for the negative external effects of
            their activities, and might lead the company’s owners (and others extracting oil in the delta) to change
            their behaviour.

Bunker Hill Company
-->
          <p class="loosen-7">
            Years earlier, a similar tale had unfolded in the USA. In 1974, a giant lead, silver, and zinc smelter owned
            by the Bunker Hill Company was the only major employer in the town of Kellogg, in the state of Idaho,
            employing 2,300 people. Many children in the town developed flu-like symptoms. Doctors discovered that they
            were the result of high lead levels in their blood—high enough to impair cognitive and social development.
          </p>
          <p>
            Three children of Bill Yoss, a welder at the smelter, had been found to have dangerously high levels of lead
            poisoning. ‘I don’t know where we’ll end up,’
            <a href="https://tinyco.re/5420273" class="show-url">he told a <em>People</em> reporter</a>. ‘We may pull
            out of the state.’
          </p>
          <p>
            The company refused to release its own tests of the smelter’s lead emission levels. Unless the state’s
            emissions regulations were relaxed, it said, the smelter would shut down—which it did, in 1981. Former
            employees searched for work elsewhere. The value of the homes and businesses in the town fell to a third of
            its earlier level. The local schools, which were supported by property taxes, did not have the funding to
            cope with those who remained.
          </p>
          <h3 id="a-model-of-conflicting-environmental-interests">A model of conflicting environmental interests</h3>
          <!--index:
environmental damage \\ abatement
-->
          <p>
            We model the Bunker Hill situation by considering a hypothetical town, Browneville, with a single firm that
            employs the entire labour force—but whose toxic emissions are a threat to the health of the citizens. The
            firm can vary the level of emissions that it imposes on the town, but the cost of emissions abatement means
            lost profits. The firm’s owner (who bears the cost) lives far enough away that the emissions do not affect
            the quality of his own environment. Therefore citizens and the firm owner have a conflict of interest over
            the level of emissions in the town. They also have an employer–employee conflict over the level of wages.
            You can think of the citizens as valuing ‘environmental quality’, which decreases when emissions increase.
          </p>
          <p>
            The citizens of the town have some power to affect the outcome because (like Angela in Cases 2 and 3) each
            is free to leave Browneville and seek employment elsewhere. So the firm must offer a package of
            environmental quality and wages that is at least as desirable as their reservation option, which is what
            they expect to receive if they leave Browneville. We call this limit on what the firm must offer the
            citizens the ‘<em>leave-town condition’</em>.
          </p>
          <div class="sidenote">
            <p>
              In 494 <span class="allsmallcaps">BCE</span> in ancient Rome, in response to judicial harassment,
              indebtedness, and poverty, the poor people (called plebs) left Rome and threatened to settle outside its
              walls and to draw up their own constitution. The threat to use their reservation option of leaving
              increased their structural power and got them their own magistrates, along with a judicial and legislative
              assembly that allowed the plebs to pass their own laws.

          <!--index:
*shutdown condition*
-->
          <p>
            Likewise, the firm owner has power in relation to the citizens—he can also ‘say no’. The wage and
            environment package must not be so costly that he prefers his reservation option, which is to shut down or
            relocate, leaving the citizens unemployed. This cost limit is the firm’s <em>‘shutdown condition’</em>. It
            places limits on the bargain that the citizens can strike with the firm.
          </p>
          <p class="tighten-11">
            We represent the preferences of the citizens and the firm in Figure 5.30, with the wage paid to the
            employees, <em>w</em>, on the horizontal axis, and the level of environmental quality experienced by the
            citizens on the vertical axis. For a simple measure of environmental quality, we use the amount that the
            firm spends on emissions reduction.
          </p>
          <p>
            We assume that, like Angela, the citizens have indifference curves that are vertical shifts of each other
            (quasi-linear preferences). Their marginal rate of substitution (MRS) between wages and environmental
            quality depends only on the wage; so at each wage the indifference curves all have the same slope.
          </p>
          <p class="tighten-7">
            The owner of the firm cares about its total costs—the wage bill plus spending on emissions reduction. We can
            show indifference curves for the firm by drawing lines through combinations of wages and environmental
            quality that have the same total costs. Along this line, total costs are constant so each additional dollar
            spent on the environment is associated with a reduction in the wage bill by a dollar. This means that the
            firm’s MRS is constant: its indifference curves are straight lines. Work through the analysis in Figure 5.30
            to determine the possible outcomes of the interaction.

            The situation illustrated in Figure 5.30 is similar to Case 3 for Angela and Bruno, in which there was a
            range of Pareto-efficient outcomes over which they could negotiate. Here again, because of our assumption
            about the citizens’ preferences, we can measure the surplus as the vertical distance between the reservation
            indifference curves of the firm and the citizens, and the Pareto efficiency curve is a straight line.
          </p>
          <h3 id="the-pareto-efficiency-curve">The Pareto efficiency curve</h3>
          <p>
            Pareto-efficient allocations of wages and environmental quality maximize the joint surplus. They occur where
            the indifference curves of the firm and citizens are tangent to each other:
          </p>
          \[\text{citizens’ MRS} = \text{firm’s MRS}\]
          <p>
            This happens at all allocations with wage <em>w</em>*: the Pareto efficiency curve is the vertical line at
            <em>w</em>* in Figure 5.30.
          </p>
          <p>
            Digging a bit deeper, our assumptions—that both environmental quality, <em>E</em>, and the wage, <em>w</em>,
            are measured in dollars, and that citizens have quasi-linear preferences—give us an easy way to measure
            changes in utility, and calculate the MRS.

            Citizens value improvements in environmental quality in the same way, irrespective of the wage. So we can
            say that an increase of $1 in <em>E</em> raises their utility by $1, whatever the wage. However, an increase
            in $1 spent on wages raises utility by an amount we denote by MU, standing for the
            <strong data-term="marginal utility">marginal utility</strong>. Citizens have diminishing marginal utility
            of wages: they value wage increases highly when the current level of wages is low, but MU diminishes as
            wages rise.
          </p>
          <p class="loosen-8">
            We can use this to understand the curved shape of the citizens’ indifference curves. To calculate the slope
            (MRS), suppose wages rise by $1. The downward slope of the indifference curve is the reduction in
            <em>E</em> that is needed to keep utility constant. <span class="keep-together"> The wage </span> rise
            increases utility by MU dollars, so the required reduction in <em>E</em> is MU dollars:
          </p>
          \[\text{citizens’ MRS} = \text{marginal utility of wages}\]
          <p>
            The flattening of the indifference curves as wages rise corresponds directly to the diminishing marginal
            utility of wages.
          </p>
          <p>
            We can calculate the firm’s MRS in the same way. Remember, the firm is indifferent between combinations of
            <em>w</em> and <em>E</em> that have the same total cost. If <em>n</em> is the size of the town’s labour
            force employed by the firm, the firm’s costs are given by:
          </p>
          \[\text{total cost} = E + wn\]
          <p>
            Suppose the wage rises by $1. The wage bill increases by <em>n</em> dollars. To keep total costs constant,
            <em>E</em> must be reduced by <em>n</em> dollars. So the downward slope of the firm’s indifference curves is
            <em>n</em> dollars:
          </p>
          \[\text{firm’s MRS} = n\]
          <p>
            Pareto-efficient allocations of wages and environmental quality occur at tangency points of the indifference
            curves—that is, where the citizens’ and firm’s MRS are equal. So the condition for Pareto efficiency is:
          </p>
          \[\text{MU} = n\]
          <p>In Figure 5.30, <em>w</em>* is the wage at which this condition is satisfied.</p>
          <h3 id="how-will-the-allocation-be-determined">How will the allocation be determined?</h3>
          <h4 id="structural-power">Structural power</h4>
          <p>The outcome of the conflict will be one of:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>the firm shuts down</li>
            <li>the citizens leave town</li>
            <li>the conflict is resolved somewhere between the shutdown condition and the leave-town condition.</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="loosen-15">
            The position of the shutdown and leave-town conditions reflects the structural power of the firm’s owner and
            the citizens. This is because the conditions are determined by the owner’s and the citizens’ next best
            alternative: the profits the firm could make by locating somewhere else or how the citizens would fare in
            some other town.
          </p>
          <!--index:

          <h4 id="bargaining-power">Bargaining power</h4>
          <p>
            If the firm does not shut down and if the citizens do not leave, then the outcome of the conflict—somewhere
            between the two conditions—will be determined by the bargaining power of the owner and the citizens. Any
            combination of wages and environmental quality in the shaded area in Figure 5.30 is a feasible allocation.
          </p>
          <p>
            Allocations on the vertical line between C and F are both feasible and Pareto efficient. If the outcome is
            on this line, the distance between C and F (<em>E</em><sup>max</sup> − <em>E</em><sup>min</sup>) is the
            total surplus. Citizens get higher rents close to C; the firm’s rent is higher near F. We cannot say which
            outcome will occur, though, unless we know more about the bargaining power of the citizens and the firm.
          </p>
          <h4 id="the-firm-has-all-the-bargaining-power">The firm has all the bargaining power</h4>
          <p>
            If the firm could simply announce a take-it-or-leave-it ultimatum, then it would choose point F. We say that
            the firm has all the bargaining power. Its costs will then be well below shutdown level; it will be making
            high profits, and freely emitting toxic materials. The difference (<em>E</em><sup>max</sup> − <em>E</em
            ><sup>min</sup>) shows up as profit in the firm’s accounts. But environmental quality is at the minimum
            level citizens can accept: (<em>E</em><sup>max</sup> − <em>E</em><sup>min</sup>) also shows up as exposure
            to health hazards in their medical records.
          </p>
          <h4 id="citizens-have-all-the-bargaining-power">Citizens have all the bargaining power</h4>
          <p class="loosen-5">
            If citizens have the power to choose for themselves, they would impose point C, with environmental quality
            <em>E</em><sup>max</sup>. The utility (or welfare) of the town’s residents would be as high as possible,
            given that the firm has to make enough profit to continue in business.
          </p>
          <h4 id="dividing-the-mutual-gains">Dividing the mutual gains</h4>
          <p>
            How the surplus from an interaction—the pie—is divided between two parties depends on their relative
            bargaining power. If both citizens and firm have some bargaining power, they may be able to achieve an
            outcome between C and F, sharing the surplus (<em>E</em><sup>max</sup> − <em>E</em><sup>min</sup>).
          </p>
          <p>
            A point such as P in <a href="#figure-5-30" class="show-page-number">Figure 5.30</a> might be possible if
            the citizens, acting jointly through their town council, imposed a legal minimal level of welfare for the
            business to continue to operate. Acting together, they would have more bargaining power than if they used
            the threat to leave town as individuals: they could require that the business’s decisions should provide a
            higher level of utility for citizens than the one on their individual leave-town condition.
          </p>
          <p>
            Bargaining power in this case would be affected not only by the two parties’ reservation options but also
            by:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <em>Enforcement capacity:</em> The town government may not have enforcement capacities to impose an
              emissions limit on the firm.
            </li>
            <li>
              <em>Verifiable information:</em> The citizens may not have sufficient information about the levels and
              dangers of emissions to win a case in court. If so, the firm would not comply with an agreed-upon
              emissions level corresponding to point P.
            </li>
            <li>
              <em>Citizen consensus:</em> If the town’s citizens were not in agreement about the dangers of the
              emissions, the elected officials of the town who legislate an emissions limit might not be re-elected.
            </li>
            <li>
              <em>Lobbying:</em> The firm may be able to convince the citizens that their health concerns were
              misplaced, or had little to do with the firm’s emissions.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span class="loosen-13">
                <em>Legal recourse:</em> The firm may be legally entitled to emit any level of emissions that it finds
                profitable (perhaps subject to having purchased permits allowing it to do this).
