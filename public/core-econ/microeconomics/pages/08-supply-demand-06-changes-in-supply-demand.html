<p class="tighten-15 keep-with-next keep-together">Quinoa is a cereal crop grown on the Altiplano, a high barren plateau in the Andes of South America. It is a traditional staple food in Peru and Bolivia. At the beginning of the twenty-first century, as its nutritional properties became known, there was a huge increase in demand from richer, health-conscious consumers in Europe and North America. Figures 8.13a and 8.13b show that the price of quinoa trebled and production almost doubled in 10 years. Figure 8.13c indicates the strength of the increase in demand: spending on imports of quinoa rose from just $2.4 million to $43.7 million.</p>

<p class="keep-with-next keep-together">For the producer countries, these changes were a mixed blessing. While their staple food became expensive for poor consumers, farmers—who are among the poorest—benefitted from the boom in export sales.</p>

<h3 id="an-increase-in-demand">An increase in demand</h3>
<p>Imagine a market in which hat sellers make and sell hats to consumers. Figure 8.14 shows the competitive equilibrium of this market. At point A, the equilibrium price equalizes the number of hats demanded by consumers and supplied by hat sellers. At this point, no one can benefit by offering or charging a different price, given the price everyone else is offering or charging—it is a Nash equilibrium.</p>
<p class="tighten-10">Suppose that hat-wearing becomes more fashionable. More people want to buy hats. Follow the steps in Figure 8.14 to analyse the effects of this increase in the demand.</p>

Raising price and quantity
</p>
<p class="slide-caption">
With excess demand, hat sellers who observe more customers realise that they could make higher profits both by raising the price and by producing more hats. They adjust prices and quantities until a new equilibrium emerges at point C.
</p>
</div><!--.figure-body-->
</div>
</div>
<p>The increase in demand moves the equilibrium from A to C, where more hats are sold at a higher price. Since the price is higher, additional hats are produced at higher marginal cost. Although more people buy hats at point C compared to point A, those with WTP between $8 and $10 (between points C and D) no longer want to buy.</p>
<p class="keep-with-next">We have described the scenario in which hats become more fashionable as an ‘increase in demand’. It’s important to understand exactly what we mean:</p>
<ul class="keep-together">
  <li>Demand is higher <em>at each possible price</em>, so the demand curve has shifted.</li>
  <li>In response to this shift, there is a change in the equilibrium price. At the current price, sellers find that they can sell more hats than before.</li>
  <li>Sellers respond to this price message by increasing the quantity supplied, <em>along</em> the supply curve.</li>
  <li>But the supply curve itself <em>has not shifted</em> (the marginal costs of hat sellers have not changed): instead the equilibrium quantity supplied has increased because of the price change.</li>
</ul>
<p>Figure 8.14 shows that if the supply curve were steeper (more inelastic), price would rise more and quantity would increase less. Conversely, if the supply curve were quite flat (elastic), then the price rise would be smaller and the quantity increase larger.</p>

<p>Shifts in demand (or supply) are often referred to as <strong data-term="exogenous shock">exogenous shocks</strong> in economic analysis. We start by specifying an economic model and find the equilibrium. Then we analyse how the equilibrium changes when something changes—the model receives a shock. The shock is called <strong data-term="exogenous">exogenous</strong> because the model doesn’t explain why it happened: it shows the consequences, not the causes.</p>
<h3 id="market-equilibration-through-rent-seeking">Market equilibration through rent-seeking</h3>
<!--index:
rent-seeking \\ equilibrium
-->
<p>How does the hat market adjust from A to C? At the original competitive equilibrium, the price of a hat was $8, and all buyers and sellers were acting as price<em>-</em>takers. When demand increases, they do not immediately know that the equilibrium price has risen to $10. If everyone were to remain a price-taker, the price would not change. But when demand shifts, some of the buyers or sellers will realise that they can benefit by being a price-<em>maker</em>, and decide to offer or charge a different price from the others.</p>
<p>For example, when a hat seller notices that every day there are customers wishing to buy hats, but none left on the shelf, she realises that some of them would be happy to pay more than the going price. And that some who had bought hats at the going price would have been willing to pay more. So she will raise her price the next day—price-taking is no longer her best strategy, and she becomes a price-maker. She does not know exactly where the new demand curve is, but she realises that now there are people who want to buy hats, but go home disappointed.</p>
<p>By raising the price, she raises her profit rate. If she was making normal profit in the original equilibrium, she is now earning an economic rent (at least temporarily)—that is, higher profits than are necessary to keep her hat business going.</p>
<p>Moreover, because hats are now being sold at prices above the marginal cost in the hat industry, some sellers will produce and sell more hats. As a result of the rent-seeking behaviour of hat sellers, a new equilibrium is reached at point C in Figure 8.14. At this point, the market again clears and none of the sellers or buyers can benefit from charging a price different from $10. They all return to being price-takers, until the next shock comes along.</p>
<dl class="definition">
<dt class="definition-term">disequilibrium rent</dt><dd class="definition-description">The economic rent that arises when a market is not in equilibrium, for example when there is excess demand or excess supply in a market for some good or service. In contrast, rents that arise in equilibrium are called equilibrium rents.</dd>
</dl>
<!--index:

rent-seeking \\ disequilibrium
-->
<p>When a market is not in equilibrium, both buyers and sellers can act as price-makers, transacting at prices different from the previous equilibrium price and earning <strong data-term="disequilibrium rent">disequilibrium rents</strong>. In the opposite case of a fall in demand for hats, there would be excess supply at the original equilibrium price of $8. A customer at the hat shop might say to the hat seller: ‘You have quite a few unsold hats piling up on your shelf. I’d be happy to buy one of those for $7.’ To the buyer this would be a bargain. But it may also be a good deal for the seller, if at the reduced level of sales $7 is still greater than the marginal cost of producing a hat.</p>

<p>As an example of an exogenous increase in supply (a supply shock), think again about the case of the bread market. The supply curve represents the marginal cost of producing bread. Suppose that bakeries discover a new technique that allows workers to make bread more quickly. This will reduce the marginal cost of a loaf at each level of output. The marginal cost curve of each bakery shifts down, and so does the market supply curve.</p>
<p>Figure 8.15 shows the original supply and demand curves for the bakeries, and what happens when marginal costs fall.</p>

  <h3 class="page-break-before" id="extension-86-changes-in-supply-and-demand"><strong>Extension 8.6</strong> Changes in supply and demand</h3>
  <div class="extension-preview">
    <p class="loosen-15">We have analysed the effects on equilibrium price and quantity of changes in market conditions by examining what happens in a diagram when the supply or demand curve shifts. In this extension, we carry out similar analyses algebraically, <em>using calculus</em> (differentiation) to determine whether equilibrium prices and quantities increase or decrease. This can be done even in cases where it is not possible to calculate explicit expressions for the equilibrium values.</p>
  </div>
  <p>If we know the demand and supply curve for a market, we can find the competitive equilibrium price and quantity by solving the two equations simultaneously for \(P\) and \(Q\). With a demand curve, \(Q=D(P)\), and supply curve, \(Q=S(P)\), the equilibrium price equalizes demand and supply:</p>
\[D(P)=S(P)\]
  <p>If we can solve this equation to find \(P\), we can then find the corresponding equilibrium quantity by substituting back into the supply or demand curve. But what happens when one of these functions changes?</p>
  <p>To model a demand or supply shock mathematically, we introduce parameters into the supply and demand curve to represent things other than price that affect the market for a good. Analysing how an equilibrium changes when a parameter changes is known in economics as comparative statics.</p>
  <h3 id="linear-supply-and-demand">Linear supply and demand</h3>
  <p>Consider first the case that you analysed in <a href="/core-econ/08-supply-demand-04-firms-in-competitive-equilibrium#exercise-e82-market-equilibrium-with-linear-functions">Exercise E8.2</a>, of a market with linear supply and demand functions:</p>
\[D(P)=a-bP, \quad S(P)=c+dP\]
  <p>where \(a,\ b,\ c,\ d\) are constants. Assume that they are all positive, and that \(a&gt;c\). This ensures that there is a single equilibrium with a positive price, \(P^*\), and positive quantity, \(Q^*\):</p>
\[P^*=\frac{a-c}{b+d} \quad Q^*= a-bP^* = \frac{ad+bc}{b+d}\]
  <h3 id="a-demand-shock">A demand shock</h3>
  <p>Suppose that in this market, there is a positive demand shock—that is, the quantity demanded is now higher at any given price. We can model a demand shock as an increase in the parameter, \(a\); if you think about the diagram, this represents a parallel rightward shift of the demand curve. It is similar to the demand shock in the market for hats shown in Figure 8.14 in the main part of this section, except that the slope of the curve doesn’t change.</p>
  <p>One method for working out the effect is to find the new equilibrium when the demand curve is \(D(P)=a+\Delta a - bP\), and the supply curve is unchanged; \(\Delta a &gt; 0\) represents the increase in \(a\). Then you can compare the new equilibrium price and quantity with the original ones.</p>
  <p>But an easier way of working out what happens to price and quantity when a parameter changes is to think of \(P^*\) and quantity \(Q^*\) as functions of the parameters, and partially differentiate with respect to the parameter that changes. So for an increase in \(a\):</p>
\[P^*=\frac{a-c}{b+d} \Rightarrow \frac{\partial P^*}{\partial a}= \frac{1}{b+d}\]
  <p>The derivative is positive; hence an increase in \(a\) results in an increase in \(P^*\). Similarly \(\frac{\partial Q^*}{\partial a}= \frac{d}{b+d}&gt;0\), so \(Q^*\) increases too.</p>
  <p>Of course, the derivatives tell us the effects of a very small increase in \(a\). But since they are positive wherever the equilibrium lies, we can deduce that a rise in \(a\), whether big or small, will always raise the equilibrium price and quantity.</p>
  <p>Also, \(\frac{\partial Q^*}{\partial a}\) is less than 1. So the increase in equilibrium quantity is smaller than the increase in \(a\). The rise in \(a\) tells us how much the quantity demanded would increase if the price stayed the same. But \(P^*\) rises, so consumers buy less than they would have done without the price change.</p>
  <p>In this example, you can easily obtain the same results diagrammatically by drawing an outward shift of the demand curve. But in other economic models, it can be difficult to be sure that your diagram captures all the possibilities, while using an algebraic method allows you to consider all the possible cases systematically.</p>
  <div class="exercise">
    <h3 id="exercise-e84-a-negative-supply-shock"><strong>Exercise E8.4</strong> A negative supply shock</h3>
    <p>For the linear supply and demand functions described in this extension, \((D(P)=a-bP, \quad S(P)=c+dP)\), use derivatives to analyse what happens to equilibrium price and quantity when there is a negative supply shock (a decrease in \(c\)). Draw a supply–demand diagram to verify your answer.</p>
  </div>
  <h3 id="the-non-linear-case">The non-linear case</h3>
  <p>If the demand and supply curves are non-linear, it can be difficult to find an explicit solution for the equilibrium price and quantity. But it is still possible to model the effect of a shock that shifts one of the curves, and work out how it affects the equilibrium. We did this diagrammatically for the bread market example. Here we do the same thing algebraically.</p>
  <p>We will write the demand curve for bread as \(Q=D(P,a)\), and the supply curve as \(Q=S(P,c)\). Introducing the two parameters, \(a\) and \(c\), enables us to model shifts in the curves—demand and supply shocks.</p>
  <p>Think first about the demand curve. The quantity demanded decreases with the price, \(P\), as before; but it also depends on a parameter, \(a\), which captures consumer tastes. A high value of \(a\) represents a situation in which consumers have a strong liking for bread, so will purchase a high quantity at any given price. When \(a\) is low, less bread is demanded at each price. The dependence of demand on both \(P\) and \(a\) can be described using the partial derivatives:</p>
\[\frac{\partial D}{\partial P} &lt; 0; \quad \frac{\partial D}{\partial a} &gt; 0\]
  <p>Then a positive demand shock can be represented as an increase in \(a\). It has the effect of increasing the quantity demanded at each price. When the demand curve is drawn in \((Q,P)\) space, as usual, it is drawn for a fixed value of \(a\). An increase in \(a\) shifts the demand curve to the right. Similarly, a fall in \(a\) represents a negative demand shock and shifts the curve to the left.</p>
  <p>In the same way, a change in the parameter, \(c\), shifts the supply curve. We can think of \(c\) as representing technology. A rise in \(c\) corresponds to a technological improvement, which lowers the marginal cost of producing bread, and hence implies that bakeries will supply more bread at any given price. So both partial derivatives are positive:</p>
\[\frac{\partial S}{\partial P} &gt; 0; \quad \frac{\partial S}{\partial c} &gt; 0\]
  <div class="sidenote">
    <p>Equivalently, since the supply curve is the marginal cost curve, it shifts the supply curve down. This is the case illustrated in <a href="/core-econ/08-supply-demand-06-changes-in-supply-demand.html#figure-8-15">Figure 8.15</a> in the main part of this section.</p>
  </div>
  <p>An increase in \(c\) shifts the supply curve to the right.</p>
  <p>For any given \(a\) and \(c\), the demand curve is downward sloping and the supply curve is upward sloping in \((Q,P)\) space. Hence, there is at most one equilibrium price \(P^*\), and corresponding equilibrium quantity \(Q^*\).</p>
  <p>In the example of linear supply and demand, we knew the exact form of the supply and demand functions, and we were able to solve the equations explicitly for the equilibrium price and quantity, in terms of the parameters. Here, that is not possible. But we know that the equilibrium price \(P^*\) (if it exists) satisfies:</p>
\[D(P^*, a)=S(P^*, c)\]
  <p>And that the quantity, \(Q^*\), is then given by:</p>
\[Q^*= S(P^*, c)\]
  <p>These two equations implicitly determine \(P^*\) and \(Q^*\). They will depend on the two parameters; we can think of them as functions of \(a\) and \(c\):</p>
\[P^* = P^*(a, c), \quad Q^* = Q^*(a, c)\]
  <p>Now, we can use what we know about \(P^*\) and \(Q^*\) to work out how they change when \(a\) or \(c\) changes. Specifically, we can use the technique of implicit differentiation to find expressions for their partial derivatives with respect to \(a\) and \(c\).</p>
  <p>First consider a change in the parameter, \(a\) (a demand shock). We differentiate the equilibrium equation with respect to \(a\), remembering that \(P^*\) depends on \(a\):</p>
\[\begin{align*} D(P^*, a)&amp;=S(P^*, c) \\
\Rightarrow \frac{\partial D}{\partial P} \frac{\partial P^*}{\partial a}+ \frac{\partial D}{\partial a}&amp;=\frac{\partial S}{\partial P} \frac{\partial P^*}{\partial a} \end{align*}\]
  <p>This equation can be rearranged to write \(\partial P^*/\partial a\) in terms of the other partial derivatives:</p>
\[\frac{\partial P^*}{\partial a} =\frac{\frac{\partial D}{\partial a}} {\frac{\partial S}{\partial P}-\frac {\partial D}{\partial P} }.\]
  <p>The denominator of this fraction is positive, because we know that \(\partial S/\partial P \gt 0\) and \(\partial D/\partial P \lt 0\). The numerator is positive too, from the way we specified the demand function, above. Hence, we can conclude that \(\partial P^*/\partial a \gt 0\). Therefore, a positive demand shock (an increase in \(a\)) leads to an increase in the equilibrium price.</p>
  <p>To find \(\partial Q^*/\partial a\), we can use the equation:</p>
\[Q^*=S(P^*, c)\]
  <p>again remembering that \(P^*\) is a function of \(a\). Differentiating with respect to \(a\):</p>
\[\frac{\partial Q^*}{\partial a} =\frac{\partial S}{\partial P^*} \frac{\partial P^*}{\partial a}\]
  <p>From this expression, since \(\partial S/\partial P^*\gt 0\) and we have just shown that \(\partial P^*/\partial a\gt0\), we deduce that \(\partial Q^*/\partial a\gt0\) too. Therefore, a positive demand shock (an increase in \(a\)) leads to an increase in both the equilibrium price and the equilibrium quantity, and a negative demand shock has the opposite effects.</p>
  <p>This result is very general. We have demonstrated that the qualitative effects of a demand shock (any shock that increases demand at each price) on the equilibrium price and quantity are the same as the ones we obtained diagrammatically in the market for hats, whatever the precise form of the supply and demand functions—provided that they have the standard properties. That is, the demand curve slopes downward, and the supply curve slopes upward.</p>
