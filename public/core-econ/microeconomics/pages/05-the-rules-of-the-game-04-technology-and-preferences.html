            5.4 Setting up a model: Technology and preferences
          </h2>
          <p>
            We will now develop a model that allows us to study differing institutions and how they affect who does
            what, and who gets what, in an economic interaction. The key idea is that institutions (the rules of the
            game) affect the choices open to people (their feasible sets) and the power that members of some groups can
            exercise over others. As summarized in the title of this unit—<em
              >The rules of the game: Who gets what and why</em
            >—different rules of the game distribute income among members of society in different ways. The institutions
            affect the efficiency and fairness of the resulting allocations of the game.
          </p>
          <p>
            We model an interaction between a farmer, Angela, who produces grain, and Bruno, who owns the land that
            Angela farms. The amount of grain produced depends on how many hours Angela works each day. We can think of
            the grain they each obtain as their income from the interaction; it is Angela’s only source of income, so if
            she receives too little grain, she will starve.
          </p>
          <p>
            Depending on the rules of the game, and her alternative options, how much power Bruno has over Angela
            differs. His power ranges from being able to threaten her physically and coerce her to work long hours,
            while receiving little of the grain she produces, to collecting a payment from her for using his land when
            she has the power simply to say no and walk away. His power is diminished when the rules change and they can
            negotiate a mutually agreeable bargain.
          </p>
          <p>
            The nature and extent of Bruno’s and Angela’s power determines how many hours Angela works and how the grain
            she produces is divided between the two. Different rules of the game result in different pay-offs for each
            player. This is another case where we use a two-person game to represent how entire groups of people
            interact in society—landowners and renters, for example.

          <p>
            We assume that (unlike the experimental participants in
            <a href="/core-econ/04-strategic-interactions-12-experimental-results.html" class="show-page-number"
              >Unit 4</a
            >, and others) our two actors are entirely self-interested: their preferences concern only what they get for
            themselves.
          </p>
          <p>
            Angela values both grain (her income, which she consumes) and free time. We can model her preferences in the
            same way as for Karim in
            <a href="/core-econ/03-scarcity-wellbeing-03-goods-and-preferences.html" class="show-page-number">Unit 3</a
            >, by drawing <strong data-term="indifference curve">indifference curves</strong>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Each point in Figure 5.3a shows a combination of grain (measured in bushels) and free time, and the
            indifference curves join together combinations that she values equally. For example, Angela is indifferent
            between having 16 hours of free time and consuming 33 bushels of grain, and having only 10 hours of free
            time but consuming 56 bushels of grain: both of these combinations are on the indifference curve
            IC<sub>3</sub>. But if we move from any point on IC<sub>3</sub> to another point above and to the right, she
            prefers that combination because it gives her more of both goods. Higher indifference curves, like IC<sub
              >4</sub
            >
            and IC<sub>5</sub>, correspond to higher levels of utility.

              Mathematically, the slope of the indifference curves is a negative number. But the MRS is a positive
              quantity representing the size of the trade-off. We often say ‘the MRS is equal to the slope’, when
              strictly speaking we mean the absolute value of the slope.

            The slope of the indifference curve at any point corresponds to the
            <strong data-term="marginal rate of substitution (MRS)">marginal rate of substitution (MRS)</strong> between
            grain and free time. It represents the trade-off Angela is willing to make between the two goods. The
            steeper the indifference curve, the more she values free time relative to grain.
          </p>
          <p>
            The more free time she has (further to the right), the flatter the curves are—as she values free time less.
            So she would be unwilling to give up much grain for an extra hour of free time. In other words, when she
            already has plenty of free time, its <strong data-term="marginal utility">marginal utility</strong>—the
            additional utility she would get from an extra hour—is low compared with the marginal utility of grain. Her
            marginal utility from free time diminishes as the amount of free time increases.

              If the vertical distance between the curves seems to get wider as you move from left to right, this is an

            We make an assumption about Angela’s preferences: her indifference curves are vertical shifts of each other.
            This means, firstly, that the vertical distance between two curves is the same whatever her amount of free
            time. The arrows in Figure 5.3b show that the distance between IC<sub>3</sub> and IC<sub>4</sub> is the same
            whether she has 12 or 18 hours of free time.

            the indifference curves where the amount of free time is 18 hours are all parallel to each other. In other

            We adopt this assumption to simplify the analysis. In particular, it allows us to measure in bushels of
            grain how much Angela’s utility differs between one allocation and another. For example, we can say that she
            prefers point Z to point Y by the equivalent of 17 bushels of grain.

            Figure 5.3c shows Bruno’s preferences using the same axes. How long Angela spends producing grain does not
            matter to him—he doesn’t care how much free time she has. He is interested only in the amount of grain that
            he, as the landowner, receives—the more the better. So his indifference curves are horizontal.

            The feasible combinations of grain, and free time for Angela, are determined by the farm’s technology for
            producing grain. Figure 5.4 shows the production function, which tells us how the amount of grain produced
            (the output) depends on how much work Angela does, (the input, measured in hours per day). It is similar to
            the grain production function in
            <a href="/core-econ/01-prosperity-inequality-06-production-function.html">Section 1.6</a>; the main
            difference is that in Section 1.6, the input is the total number of farmers working the land, whereas here
            it is the number of hours worked per day on one farm by a single farmer.

            If Angela works for five hours a day, she produces 37 bushels of grain (point T in the figure). Her
            <strong data-term="average product">average product</strong> of labour is 37/5 = 7.4 bushels. The average
            product corresponds to the slope of the ray from the origin to point T. Her production function (again like
            the one in Section 1.6) has a concave shape: the average product of an hour’s work diminishes as the number
            of hours increases. As before, this happens because the amount of land available is fixed: working twice as
            many hours on the same amount of land would not double its output.

            Using the information in Figure 5.4, we can work out which combinations of grain production and free time
            for Angela are feasible. As in Unit 3, what we call free time is all of the time that is not spent working
            to produce grain—it includes time for eating, sleeping, and everything else that we don’t count as farm
            work, as well as her leisure time. We know, for example, that by working for five hours, Angela could
            produce 37 bushels of grain. So 19 hours of free time and 37 bushels of grain are feasible. In the table in
            Figure 5.5, we have worked out the amounts of free time corresponding to each quantity of grain produced.
            Then we have plotted each combination of grain and free time to obtain the

          <p>
            The feasible frontier in Figure 5.5 is the mirror image of the production function in Figure 5.4, with free
            time instead of hours of work on the horizontal axis. It shows how much grain can be produced and consumed
            for each possible amount of free time.

            Angela would have to give up to get one more unit of free time. The table in Figure 5.5 shows that if Angela
            were to reduce her free time from 19 hours (at point T) to 18 hours, her production of grain would increase
            from 37 to 41 bushels. So the marginal rate of transformation at point T is four bushels per hour.

            the more free time she takes, the greater is the MRT—when she already has a lot of free time the opportunity
            cost of taking another hour is higher: how much grain she has to give up.

                  The indifference curves are flatter for combinations to the right, but the reason is diminishing
                  marginal utility of free time, not of grain. When Angela has more free time, she values free time less
                  relative to grain, compared to when she has very little free time.

                  Angela’s indifference curves have this particular property, so her MRS depends on her amount of free

                  The production function shows how much grain Angela can produce for each hour she works. Since there

              Angela’s technology and preferences have properties that can plausibly be assumed to hold in many economic
              models. Her production function has a concave shape, like the agricultural production function in
              <a href="/core-econ/01-prosperity-inequality-06-production-function.html" class="show-page-number"
                >Unit 1</a
              >: it slopes upward, but gets gradually flatter as working hours increase. Her preferences, like those of
              Karim in Unit 3, are convex (as discussed in
              <a
                href="/core-econ/03-scarcity-wellbeing-03-goods-and-preferences.html#extension-33-indifference-curves-marginal-changes-and-the-marginal-rate-of-substitution"

              right. In addition, her preferences have a special property that is useful in some models: they are
              quasi-linear.

              In this extension, we describe these properties mathematically. First, it is helpful to clarify what we

              Figure E5.1 compares the graphs of four possible functions, \(y=f(x)\). The top two are both increasing
              functions (their slopes are positive), as we would generally expect production functions to be. The
              left-hand one is concave—like all the examples of production functions we use in Units 1 to 5. Its slope
              decreases as \(x\) increases, so if we join any two points on the curve, the line lies below the curve.
              The right-hand one illustrates a convex production function: its slope increases with \(x\), so a line
              joining any two points on the curve lies above the curve.

              The bottom two are both decreasing functions—we draw decreasing functions to represent indifference
              curves, for example. The left-hand one is concave: as \(x\) increases, its slope <em>decreases</em>,
              getting <em>more negative</em>. Be careful here; the curve gets steeper because the absolute value of the
              slope increases, but the slope itself is decreasing. Hence \(f''(x)&lt;0\): it is concave. The bottom
              right shows a convex decreasing function; this is the shape we expect most indifference curves to have.
              The curve gets flatter (its slope gets less negative) as \(x\) increases, which corresponds to a positive
              second derivative.
            </p>
            <p>
              Joining two points on the curve with a straight line is a quick and easy way to distinguish between
              concave and convex functions. In Figure E5.1, the line lies below the curve for the two concave functions
              on the left, and above for the two convex functions on the right.

              Angela’s production function, shown in <a href="#figure-5-4" class="show-page-number">Figure 5.4</a>, is
              similar to the grain production function in

              output rose in proportion to labour, the production function would be a straight line, with a constant
              slope. But in each of these examples, other inputs to production (land, or machinery) are fixed, so output
              rises less than proportionally to the labour input: the slope of the function gradually decreases as more
              labour is employed. In other words, these examples all have increasing and strictly concave production
              functions.
            </p>
            <p>
              Figure E5.2a shows another increasing and strictly concave function, which we will suppose is the
              production function, \(y=g(h)\), of a farmer like Angela, where \(h \ge 0\) is daily hours of work, \(y\)
              is the number of bushels of grain produced, and \(g(0)=0\).
            </p>
            <p>The function shown has a simple algebraic form that is often used in economic examples:</p>
            \[g(h)=ah^b \text{ where $a$ and $b$ are constants: } a&gt;0, 0&lt;b&lt;1\]
            <p>In the figure, \(a=10\) and \(b=0.4\).</p>
            <p>
              The figure shows that the function \(g(h)\) is increasing and strictly concave. We can verify this
              algebraically, using what we know about the constants, \(a\) and \(b\):
            </p>
            \[g'(h) = abh^{b-1}&gt;0 \text{ and } g''(h)=ab(b-1)h^{b-2}&lt;0 \text{ for all } h&gt;0\]

              <strong data-term="marginal product">marginal product</strong> of labour: that is, how much additional
              output is produced as more labour is employed. In other words, it is the rate at which output rises with
              increases in labour:
            </p>
            \[\text{MPL} = g'(h)\]
            <p>
              Here, we define the marginal product of labour as the rate of increase of output corresponding to a small
              (infinitesimal) increase in the input, although it is often interpreted as the rise in output when the
              labour input rises by one whole unit (one hour, or one worker, for example)—which is not quite the same.

                >, we use the calculus method to measure marginal changes in the mathematical extensions, while in the
                main sections, we usually measure them as the effect of an increase in one unit. In general, the rate of
                increase, \(g'(h)\), differs from the rise in output when \(h\) increases by one unit, which is
                \(g(h+1)-g(h)\)—unless \(h\) is measured in very small units.

              Figure E5.2a shows the tangent to the production function at point P where \(h=5\) and \(y=19.04\). The
              slope of the tangent is 1.52—that is, \(g'(5)=1.52\). We say that when \(h=5\) the marginal product of
              labour is 1.52 bushels of grain per hour. When the production function is concave, the marginal product of
              labour diminishes as the labour input rises.

                The average product of an input is total output divided by the total amount of the input. For example,
                the average product of a worker (also known as labour productivity) is total output divided by the
                number of workers employed to produce it.

            <p>
              The marginal product is not the same as the <strong data-term="average product">average product</strong>.
              The average product of labour at \(h\) hours of work is the average amount produced over all the \(h\)
              hours of labour employed:
            </p>
            \[\text{APL} = \frac{g(h)}{h}\]
            <p>
              In Figure E5.2a, the APL at point P corresponds to the slope of the ray from the origin to P, which is
              19.04/5 = 3.8.
            </p>
            <p>
              We noted in the main part of this section that Angela’s APL diminishes with her hours of work. This
              property holds for any strictly concave production function. Intuitively, if an extra hour adds less to
              output than each of the hours previously worked (MPL is diminishing), then the average output over all
              hours worked must also go down (APL is diminishing).
            </p>
            <p>
              Furthermore, if we differentiate the average product with respect to \(h\) using the quotient rule, we
              get:
            </p>
            \[\frac{d \text{APL}}{dh} = \frac{d}{dh} \left( \frac{g(h)}{h} \right) = \left( \frac{hg'(h) - g(h)}{h^2}
            \right)\]
            <p>
              So the property that the average product is diminishing is equivalent to the property that the marginal
              product is less than the average product:
            </p>
            \[\begin{align*} \frac{d \text{APL}}{dh} &lt; 0 &amp; \Rightarrow hg'(h) - g(h) &lt; 0 \Rightarrow g'(h)
            &lt; \frac{g(h)}{h} \end{align*}\]
            <p>
              Figure E5.2a shows this property: the slope of the tangent at P is less than the slope of the line between
              P and the origin. We can prove it directly for production functions of the form, \(g(h)=ah^b\), where
              \(a&gt;0\) and \(0&lt;b&lt;1\):

              To find the equation of Angela’s feasible frontier we rewrite the technology in terms of the two things
              that are <strong data-term="goods">goods</strong> for her: output and hours of free time, \(t\). Since
              \(h=24-t\), the feasible frontier is:

            \[y=g(24-t)\]
            <p>

            \[\frac{dy}{dt}=g'(24-t)\frac{d}{dt}(24-t)=-g'(24-t)\]

              Since \(g\) is an increasing function \((g'&gt;0)\), we can deduce that the slope of the feasible frontier
              is negative. Furthermore, by differentiating again we can deduce that it is strictly concave:
            </p>
            \[\frac{d^2y}{dt^2}=-g''(24-t)\frac{d}{dt}(24-t)=g''(24-t)&lt;0\]

            \[\text{MRT}=\left|\frac{dy}{dt}\right|=g'(24-t)\]
            <p>
              The MRT is equal to the marginal product of labour. The MRT increases along the frontier, as \(t\) rises
              and \(y\) falls:

            \[\frac{d\text{MRT}}{dt}=-g''(24-t)&gt;0\]
            <p>
              When the production function is \(g(h)=ah^b\), the equation of the feasible frontier is \(y=a(24-t)^b\).
              Differentiating (and remembering that \(a&gt;0\) and \(0&lt;b&lt;1\)):
            </p>
            \[\begin{align*} \frac{dy}{dt}&amp;=-ab(24-t)^{b-1}&lt;0;\ \frac{d^2y}{dt^2}=ab(b-1)(24-t)^{b-2} &lt; 0

            <p>
              So the feasible frontier is decreasing and concave in \(t\), and the MRT is \(ab(24-t)^{b-1}\). Figure

              \(b=0.4\). The feasible frontier is the mirror image of the production function.

                someone has more of one good (relative to another) they are willing to give up more of it in exchange
                for a unit of the other good: their marginal rate of substitution falls along the curve.

              <strong data-term="convex preferences">convex preferences</strong>. The absolute value of the slope of the
              indifference curve—the marginal rate of substitution—falls as the amount of the good on the horizontal
              axis increases; in other words (as seems plausible) the more they have of that good, the more willing they
              are to trade it for the other. If we write the equation of the indifference curve so that the good on one
              axis is a function of the good on the other axis, it is a convex function.

              But Angela’s preferences for consumption and free time also have a special property: her indifference
              curves are vertical shifts of each other. This property is known as
              <strong data-term="quasi-linear, quasi-linear function">quasi-linearity</strong>. It implies, as explained
              in the main part of this section, that her MRS between grain and free time depends on the amount of free
              time she has, but does not change if she receives more or less grain. The assumption that preferences are
              quasi-linear is less plausible in general, but it is a useful simplification that is used in some models
              to help us focus on particular aspects of a problem.
            </p>
            <p>
              Let \(t\) be Angela’s daily hours of free time, and \(c\) the number of bushels of grain that she consumes
              per day. Quasi-linearity is illustrated in Figure 5.3b, reproduced below as Figure E5.3. Remember that the
              MRS at any point is the slope of the indifference curve. The figure shows that all the tangents at
              \(t=18\) are parallel to each other. So if Angela has 18 hours of free time, her MRS is the same however
              much grain she consumes.

            \[u(t, c) = c + v(t)\]
            <p>
              where \(v\) is an increasing function of \(t\): \(v'(t) \gt 0\) because Angela prefers more free time to
              less. A utility function like this is called <em>quasi-linear</em> because utility is linear in \(c\). We
              now show that this utility function has the required property.

                >Extension 3.3</a

            </p>
            \[\text{MRS} = \frac{\partial u}{\partial t} \left/ \frac{\partial u}{\partial c} \right.\]
            <p>
              Applying this formula to the case of the quasi-linear utility function, \(\frac{\partial u}{\partial
              t}=v'(t)\) and \(\frac{\partial u}{\partial c}=1\), so:
            </p>
            \[\text{MRS} = v'(t)\]
            <p>
              Hence Angela’s MRS between consumption and free time depends on how much free time, \(t\), she has, but
              not on her consumption, \(c\).
            </p>
            <p>
              The same result can be obtained directly, without using the general formula. The equation of an
              indifference curve is \(v(t) + c = u_0\) where \(u_0\) is a constant. Rearranging this equation, we can
              write \(c\) in terms of \(t\):
            </p>
            \[c=u_0-v(t)\]
            <p>
              Hence the slope of an indifference curve is \(\frac{dc}{dt}=-v’(t)\), and the MRS is the absolute value of
              the slope, \(v'(t)\).
            </p>
            <p>
              Writing the indifference curves this way also demonstrates that they are vertical shifts of each other.
              The vertical distance between an indifference curve corresponding to utility level, \(u_0\), and another
              with higher utility, \(u_1\), is \((u_1-v(t))-(u_0-v(t))=u_1-u_0\), which doesn’t depend on \(t\).
            </p>
            <h3 id="convex-quasi-linear-preferences">Convex quasi-linear preferences</h3>
            <p>
              In Figure E5.3, the indifference curves are both quasi-linear, and convex—they have the usual property of
              diminishing MRS, flattening as you move to the right. Since the MRS is \(v'(t)\), it must be the case that
              \(v’(t)\) falls at \(t\) increases. In other words, quasi-linear preferences are also convex if:
            </p>
            \[v''(t) &lt; 0\]
            <p>
              Somewhat confusingly, this means that \(v(t)\) must be a concave function. As noted above, we can
              rearrange the indifference curves to write \(c\) as a function of \(t\): \(c=u_0-v(t)\). Then:
            </p>
            \[\frac{dc}{dt}=-v'(t) \text { and }\frac{d^2c}{dt^2}=- v''(t)\]
            <p>Hence the indifference curves are convex if and only if \(v(t)\) is concave: \(v''(t) &gt; 0\).</p>
            <h3 id="why-do-we-use-the-assumption-that-preferences-are-quasi-linear">
              Why do we use the assumption that preferences are quasi-linear?
            </h3>
            <p>
              Using a quasi-linear utility function means that we are making a restrictive assumption about preferences,
              which would not be plausible in all economic models. But it has a very useful implication. Because utility
              is of the form \('c + \text{something}'\), it is measured in the same units as consumption. Angela values
              \(t\) hours of free time as much as \(v(t)\) bushels of grain.
            </p>
            <p>
              This is particularly useful for a model of a worker who values free time, and also all the goods she can
              buy with the income she earns. Imagine that, rather than simply consuming grain, Angela can sell grain on
              the market and purchase other food or clothes—or anything else—with the proceeds. Then everything other
              than free time can be valued in the same units: money income. If we model her preferences as quasi-linear,
              we can use money income to measure overall gains and loss of utility resulting from changes in
              consumption, free time, or both.
            </p>
            <h3 id="quasi-linearity-an-example">Quasi-linearity: An example</h3>
            <p>An example of a quasi-linear utility function is:</p>
            \[u(t,\ c) = c+ \beta t^\alpha\]
            <p>
              where \(\beta\) and \(\alpha\) are positive constants and \(\alpha\lt1\). It has the general form, \(v(t)
              +c\), with \(v(t)= \beta t^\alpha\). To demonstrate that it is a quasi-linear utility function as
              described above, we must show that the function, \(v\), is increasing and concave in \(t\). This is easily
              done:
            </p>
            \[v'(t)= \alpha \beta t^{\alpha -1}\]
            <p>which is positive because \(\beta\) and \(\alpha\) are positive, and</p>
            \[v''(t)= (\alpha -1)\alpha \beta t^{\alpha -2}\]
            <p>which is negative because \(\beta &gt; 0\) and \(0\lt\alpha &lt; 1\).</p>
            <p>
              Alternatively, we can start with the equation of an indifference curve in the form \(c=u_0-\beta
              t^\alpha\), and differentiate to find \(\frac{dc}{dt}\) and \(\frac{d^2c}{dt^2}\).
