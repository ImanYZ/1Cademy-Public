<p>Before the upward kink in history’s hockey stick, some people were rich by the standards of their day, but most people in the world lived in extreme poverty.</p>

  <p>To explore the latest data on extreme poverty, read <a href="https://tinyco.re/9647535" class="show-url">Our World in Data’s webpage on ‘Poverty’</a>.</p>
</div>
<p>Mirroring the hockey sticks of income and carbon is the transformation from a world in which the vast majority of people were unable to meet their basic needs of minimal nutrition and adequately heated shelter to today, when that is true of around one in ten (Figure 1.3). These people are often hungry, don’t have access to electricity (and therefore to light at night, for example), and have limited access to schooling or healthcare.</p>

<p>A thousand years ago, the world was flat, economically speaking. There were major differences in income within the world’s countries and regions; but as shown in <a href="/core-econ/01-prosperity-inequality-02-historys-hockey-stick.html#figure-1-1" class="show-page-number">Figure 1.1</a>, the differences between countries were small, especially when compared to what was to follow.</p>
<h3 id="income-inequality-between-countries">Income inequality between countries</h3>
<div class="sidenote">
  <p>For example, 14% of the world’s population live in countries with lower average income than India. Since 18% of the world’s population live in India, a total of 32% live in countries with average income less than or equal to that in India.</p>

<p>Nobody thinks the world is flat today, when it comes to income. Figure 1.4 provides a snapshot for 2019. The countries of the world are lined up from left to right by average income, the poorest (South Sudan) on the left and the richest (United Arab Emirates) on the right. The width of the bars reflects the size of the population, with the bars for China and India much the widest. The horizontal scale shows the cumulative share of the world’s population, with 100% at the far right. On the vertical axis is the average daily income—measured in such a way that $20, for example, is what a person in any given country can buy in goods and services that cost $20 in the US. Economists measure prices using <strong data-term="purchasing power parity (PPP)">purchasing power parity</strong> to make these comparisons. In the bottom 10% of countries, where people on average live in extreme poverty, the daily income is just a few dollars a day. The snapshot provided by average incomes shows big differences between countries, but it does not show the vast differences in living standards within each country.</p>

<p><a href="/core-econ/01-prosperity-inequality-02-historys-hockey-stick.html#figure-1-1" class="show-page-number">Figure 1.1</a> showed the great divergence in fortunes across the world beginning around the seventeenth century and taking off in the eighteenth. Extreme poverty has shrunk. But stark inequalities in income persist within countries—and have increased in recent decades. While Figure 1.4 shows the average income in each country, <a href="/core-econ/01-prosperity-inequality-04-income-inequality.html#figure-1-5">Figure 1.5</a> goes a step further by building a 3D picture that shows the distribution of income <em>within countries</em> as well as between them, and how this changed between 1980 and 2020.</p>
<p class="loosen-10">Again, countries are arranged from the poorest (according to average income in that year) on the left of the diagram (South Sudan in 1980) to the richest on the right (Switzerland in 1980), with the width of each country’s bars representing its population.</p>
<dl class="definition hyphens-manual">
<dt class="definition-term">decile, decile groups</dt><dd class="definition-description">Deciles split a set of observations into ten equally-sized groups. The full set of observations is ordered according to a particular variable (e.g. income). The first decile group is the observations in the bottom 10% (e.g. the 10% with the lowest incomes), the second is the next lowest 10%, and the tenth or top decile group is the highest 10%. The deciles are the cutoff values that separate the groups; the first decile is the cutoff between the first and second decile groups, and so on.</dd>
</dl>
<!--index:
decile \\ definition
-->
<p>For every country there are ten bars, corresponding to the ten <strong data-term="decile, decile groups">decile groups</strong> of income. Each group contains 10% of the population, and the height of the bar is the average income of the group, ranging from the poorest 10% of people at the front of the diagram to the richest 10% at the back, measured in 2021 US dollars. Note that this measure doesn’t mean ‘the richest 10% of income earners’. It is the richest 10% of people, where each person in a household, including children, is assumed to have an equal share of the household’s income.</p>
<!--index:
Norway \\ GDP per capita
Norway \\ equality
-->
<p>The skyscrapers (the highest columns) at the back of the right-hand side of the figure represent the income of the richest 10% in the richest countries. In 2020, the tallest skyscraper represents the richest 10% of people in the United Arab Emirates. In 2020, this exclusive group had an income per capita of around $390,000. Norway, the country with the second-highest GDP per capita, does not have a particularly tall skyscraper (it is hidden between the skyscrapers for the United Arab Emirates and the third-richest country, the US) because income is more evenly distributed in Norway than in some other rich countries. Go through the steps in Figure 1.6 to understand how income within and between countries has changed over time.</p>

<!--index:
rich/poor ratio
-->
<p class="tighten-5">Two things are clear from the 2020 distribution. First, in every country, the rich have much more than the poor. We can use the ratio between the heights of the front and back bars as one measure of inequality in a country. We will call it the rich/poor ratio, for obvious reasons. Even in a relatively equal country such as Norway, the rich/poor ratio is 66; in the US, it is 244; and in Botswana in southern Africa, it is 489. Inequality within the very poorest countries is difficult to determine from the graph because the height of all the bars are much smaller than those of the richer countries, but inequality is definitely there: the rich/poor ratio is 174 in Nigeria, and 246 in India.</p>
<p>The second thing that jumps out from <a href="/core-econ/01-prosperity-inequality-04-income-inequality.html#figure-1-5">Figure 1.5</a> is the huge difference in income between countries. In 2020, the average income in Norway is nearly seven times the average income in Nigeria.</p>
<!--index:

<p>Imagine the traveller Ibn Battuta’s journey across regions of the world in the fourteenth century and think of how a diagram like <a href="/core-econ/01-prosperity-inequality-04-income-inequality.html#figure-1-5" class="show-page-number">Figure 1.5</a> would have looked then. He would, of course, notice that everywhere he went there were differences between the richest and poorest groups in the population of each region. He would report back that the differences in income between the countries of the world were relatively minor by comparison.</p>
<p>The vast differences in income between the countries of the world today take us back to <a href="/core-econ/01-prosperity-inequality-02-historys-hockey-stick.html#figure-1-1" class="show-page-number">Figure 1.1</a>, where we can begin to understand how this came about. The countries that took off economically before 1900, such as Britain, Japan, and Italy, are now rich. They (and countries like them) are in the skyscraper part of Figure 1.5. The countries that took off only recently, or not at all, are in the flatlands.</p>
<p>What lies behind the upward kink in the hockey sticks that we have seen in some countries but not others, and the accompanying changes in poverty and inequality? We begin to answer this question in the next section.</p>
