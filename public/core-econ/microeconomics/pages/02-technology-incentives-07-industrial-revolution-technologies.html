<p class="tighten-15 keep-together">What was the impact of inventions such as the spinning jenny? The first spinning jennies had eight spindles. A machine operated by just one adult replaced eight spinsters working on eight spinning wheels. By the late nineteenth century, a single spinning mule operated by a small number of people could replace more than 1,000 spinsters. These machines did not rely on human energy; they were powered first by water wheels, and later by coal-powered steam engines. Figure 2.11 summarizes these changes.</p>

<p>The model in <a href="/core-econ/02-technology-incentives-06-innovation-profit.html" class="show-page-number">Section 2.6</a> provides a hypothesis (potential explanation) for why someone would bother to invent such a technology, and why someone would want to use it. In the model, cloth producers chose between technologies using just two inputs—energy and labour. This is a simplification, but it shows the importance of the relative costs of inputs for the choice of technology. When the cost of labour increased relative to the cost of energy, there were innovation rents to be earned from a switch to the energy-intensive technology.</p>
<p>This is just a hypothesis. Is it actually what happened? Looking at how relative prices differed among countries, and how they changed over time, can help us understand why technologies such as the spinning jenny were invented in Britain rather than elsewhere, and in the eighteenth century rather than at an earlier time.</p>

<p>Figure 2.12 shows the price of labour relative to the price of energy in six cities in the early 1700s—specifically, the wages of building labourers divided by the price of 1 million BTU (British Thermal Units, a unit of energy equivalent to slightly more than 1,000 joules). Labour was more expensive relative to the cost of energy in England and the Netherlands than in France (Paris and Strasbourg), and much more so than in China.</p>
<p class="loosen-15">The relative price was high in England for two reasons: English wages were higher than wages elsewhere, and coal was cheaper in coal-rich Britain than in the other countries.</p>

<p>Figure 2.13 compares the price of labour relative to capital goods in England and France, from the late sixteenth to the early nineteenth century. It shows the wages of building labourers divided by the cost of using capital goods. This cost is calculated from the prices of metal, wood, and brick and the cost of borrowing, and takes account of the rate at which the capital goods wear out, or depreciate.</p>
<!--index:
wages \\ and incentives 
-->
<p class="tighten-10 keep-together">The figure shows that wages relative to the cost of capital goods were similar in England and France in the mid-seventeenth century, but that from then on, in England but not in France, workers became steadily more expensive relative to capital goods. In other words, the incentive to replace workers with machines was increasing in England during this time, but this was not true in France. In France, the incentive to save labour by innovating had been stronger during the late sixteenth century than it was 200 years later, at the time the Industrial Revolution began to transform Britain.</p>
<p class="loosen-15">From the model in the previous section, we learned that the technology chosen depends on relative input prices. Combining the predictions of the model with the historical data, we have one explanation for the timing and location of the Industrial Revolution.</p>
<p class="keep-with-next">That is, relative to the costs of both energy and capital goods:</p>
<ul>
  <li>wages—initially the pay women received for spinning cotton thread—rose in the eighteenth century in Britain compared with earlier historical period</li>
  <li>wages were higher in Britain during the eighteenth century than elsewhere.</li>
</ul>
<p class="loosen-15">No doubt it helped, too, that Britain was such an inventive country. There were many skilled engineers and machine makers who could build the machines that inventors designed.</p>
<p>Figure 2.14 summarizes the application of our model to Britain. In the 1600s, the relative price of labour to energy was low and technology B on isocost line HJ was used. B was cheaper than A. In the eighteenth century, when the relative price of labour was high, A was cheaper. Firms switched to the energy-intensive technology A on isocost line FG.</p>

<p>The relative prices of labour, energy, and capital can help to explain why the labour-saving technologies of the Industrial Revolution were first adopted in England, and why at that time technology advanced more rapidly there than elsewhere.</p>
<p>What explains the eventual adoption of these new technologies in countries like France and Germany, and ultimately China and India? One answer is further technological progress, where a new technology is developed that dominates the existing one in use—meaning that it takes smaller quantities of inputs to produce 100 metres of cloth. We can use the model to illustrate this. In Figure 2.15, technological progress leads to the invention of a superior energy-intensive technology, labelled A′. The analysis in Figure 2.15 shows that once technology A′ is available, it would be chosen in countries using A, and also in those using B.</p>

<p class="slide-caption">
Technology A′ is cheaper than both A and B, both in countries where wages are relatively high (isocost line FG) and in low-wage, expensive-energy economies (isocost line HJ). The new labour- and energy-saving technology, A′, is inside FG and HJ, so it will be adopted in both economies.
</p>
</div><!--.figure-body-->
</div>
</div>
<p class="loosen-10">A second factor that promoted the diffusion of the new technologies across the world was wage growth and falling energy costs (due, for example, to cheaper transportation, allowing countries to import energy cheaply from abroad). Both rising wages and falling energy costs in poorer countries steepened the isocost lines, providing an incentive to switch to a labour-saving technology.<sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p>Either way, the new technologies spread, and the divergence in technologies and living standards was eventually replaced by convergence—at least among those countries where the capitalist revolution had taken off.<sup id="fnref:5" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></p>
<p>Nevertheless, in some countries we still observe the use of technologies that were replaced in Britain during the Industrial Revolution. The model predicts that the relative price of labour must be very low in such situations, making the isocost line very flat. Technology B could be preferred in <a href="/core-econ/02-technology-incentives-07-industrial-revolution-technologies.html#figure-2-15">Figure 2.15</a> even when technology A′ is available if the isocost line is flatter than HJ, so that it goes through B but below A′.</p>

    <h3 id="question-29-choose-the-correct-answers"><strong>Question 2.9</strong> Choose the correct answer(s)</h3>
    <p><a href="/core-econ/02-technology-incentives-07-industrial-revolution-technologies.html#figure-2-14">Figure 2.14</a> depicts isocost lines for the 1600s and the 1700s in Britain. Based on this information, read the following statements and choose the correct option(s).</p>
    <ul class="mcq-options">
      <li>The flatter isocost line HJ for seventeenth century Britain indicates higher wages relative to the price of coal.</li>
      <li>The increase in wages relative to the cost of energy in the 1700s is represented by the outward shift of the isocost line from HJ to the parallel isocost line going through A.</li>
      <li>At the same time as the fall in energy costs, if the wage level had also fallen, then eighteenth century Britain would definitely have stayed with technology B.</li>
      <li>The comparison between isocost line FG and the parallel isocost line going through B suggests that an innovation rent was earned in eighteenth century Britain, when firms moved from technology B to A.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul class="mcq-feedback">
      <li>The slope of the isocost line is the negative of the price ratio, −(wage/price of coal). A flatter isocost line indicates lower wages relative to the price of coal.</li>
      <li>An increase in the level of wages relative to the cost of energy would lead to a steeper isocost line.</li>
      <li>The relative price matters, not the absolute level. So if wages fall, but by relatively less than the energy costs so that the price ratio still increases, then technology A may still be the better choice.</li>
      <li>The comparison between these two lines shows that the cost of production is lower at A than at B. Therefore, firms adopting technology A enjoy some profit in excess of that which they earned with the alternative: an innovation rent.</li>
