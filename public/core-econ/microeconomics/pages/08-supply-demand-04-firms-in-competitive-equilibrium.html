            In the second-hand textbook example, both buyers and sellers are individual actors. Now we analyse markets
            in which firms sell identical goods.

            explains how firms choose their price and quantity when producing differentiated goods. The more competition
            there is from other firms producing similar products, the more restricted is the choice of price: the firm’s
            demand curve is then quite flat (elastic) because raising the price would cause consumers to switch to other
            similar brands.
          </p>
          <!--index:
firms \\ price takers
-->
          <p>
            If products are identical and consumers can easily switch from one firm to another, the choice of price is
            extremely restricted: firms will be price-takers in equilibrium.

            Imagine a city where many small bakeries produce bread and sell it directly to consumers. Figure 8.7 shows
            the market demand curve for one product, a large baguette: the total amount demanded at each price by all
            consumers in the city. It is downward-sloping as usual because at higher prices, fewer consumers will be
            willing to buy.

            Suppose that you are the owner of one small bakery that specializes in baguette production. You have to
            decide what price to charge, and how many to produce each morning. Suppose that neighbouring bakeries are
            selling loaves identical to yours at €2.35. This is the prevailing market price, and you will not be able to
            sell loaves at a higher price than other bakeries, because no one would buy—you are a price-taker. But at
            €2.35, there are many consumers willing to buy, so you can sell as many loaves as you wish.
          </p>
          <!--index:

          <p>
            What you should do depends on your costs of production—and, in particular, on your marginal costs. You have
            some fixed costs—the costs associated with your premises and equipment—but you have to pay these
            irrespective of the number of loaves you produce. It is the additional costs of actually making each loaf of
            bread—the cost of the ingredients, and what you have to pay your employees for the time it takes to bake a
            loaf—that determine whether you should produce 30, 50, or 100 loaves per day. Once you have installed
            mixers, ovens, and other equipment, the marginal cost of each extra loaf may be relatively low, as long as
            you don’t exceed the capacity of your equipment.
          </p>
          <p>
            Figure 8.8 illustrates this situation. You have the capacity to produce up to 120 loaves per day at a
            constant marginal cost of €1.50. If you want to produce more than 120 loaves with your current equipment,
            you will have to operate overnight, paying overtime wage rates and higher energy costs. You could then
            produce up to 60 more loaves, at a marginal cost of €2.60.
          </p>
          <p>
            The horizontal line at <em>P</em> = €2.35 represents the demand for bread from your bakery—because you are a
            price-taker, each loaf you produce can be sold for €2.35.
          </p>
          <p>
            In this example, it is easy to find the profit-maximizing price and quantity without drawing isoprofit
            curves. Work through Figure 8.8 to understand how to do it.

            Your best choice is <em>P</em> = €2.35 and <em>Q</em> = 120; you maximize profit by making as many loaves as
            possible at a marginal cost below the market price. Your profit will be the total surplus on 120 loaves

            Importantly, when you are a price-taker, it is not the <em>market</em> demand curve in Figure 8.7 that
            determines how many loaves you can sell at different prices; it is the price charged by your competitors. So
            we can think of the horizontal line at <em>P</em> = €2.35 in Figure 8.8 as your firm’s demand curve: as in
            Unit 7 it is the feasible frontier for your price and quantity. If you charge more than €2.35, your demand
            will be zero—but at €2.35 or less, you can sell as many loaves as you like.

          <p>
            A firm in a competitive market equilibrium does not <em>choose a price</em>. It accepts the market price,
            and chooses a quantity that depends on its marginal cost. Figure 8.8 shows how many loaves you will produce
            when the market price is €2.35. What would you do if the price changed? Your profit-maximizing quantity
            would depend on how the price compared with your marginal cost:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              If the price falls <em>below €1.50</em>, you should immediately stop making bread. You would make a loss
              on every loaf produced.
            </li>
            <li>
              As long as the price remains <em>between €1.50 and €2.60</em>, your profit-maximizing quantity remains the
              same. You should produce 120 loaves.
            </li>
            <li>
              If the price rises <em>above €2.60</em>, it is higher than your marginal cost of producing additional
              loaves overnight. You now maximize profit by expanding output to a total of 180 loaves.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <div class="sidenote">
            <p class="tighten-5">
              It may seem surprising that we say that ‘price equals marginal cost’ in Figure 8.8. The profit-maximizing
              quantity is 120, and marginal cost jumps from €1.50 to €2.60 at this point. In the case of a jump in
              marginal costs, the point where the marginal cost function crosses the price line lies between the two
              marginal costs.

            <dd class="definition-description">
              A supply curve shows the number of units of output that would be supplied to the market at any given
              price. The firm’s supply curve shows the units supplied by an individual firm, and the market (or
              industry) supply curve shows the total number of units supplied by all sellers in the market (or firms in
              the industry). <em class="definition-cross-reference">Also known as: supply function.</em>

            So the marginal cost function in Figure 8.8 is your firm’s
            <strong data-term="supply curve">supply curve</strong>: it tells you the number of loaves to produce for
            each level of the market price. Your profit-maximizing quantity can be found at the point where your
            marginal cost function crosses a horizontal line at the level of the market price. This result—that price
            equals marginal cost—is true for any firm in a competitive equilibrium when marginal cost is constant or
            increasing with quantity. We discuss another example in the extension to this section.
          </p>
          <p class="keep-together">
            But remember that you also have fixed costs. It is possible that even at the profit-maximizing quantity,
            your surplus is too small to cover the fixed costs and leave you with a profit overall. This is most likely
            to happen if the market price is only just above €1.50. 120 loaves is still the best choice, because the
            surplus covers some of your fixed costs. If you expect the price to rise soon, it might be worth continuing
            to produce bread despite the short-term losses, so that the revenue helps you to cover the costs of
            maintaining your premises and retaining staff. If not, you may need to consider closing the business.

            products they make and sell. Those who specialize in producing baguettes have more suitable premises,
            equipment, and staff skills, so they can produce at lower marginal costs than others.
          </p>
          <p>
            Each bakery has a supply curve shaped similarly to the one in Figure 8.8, with a maximum capacity at
            constant marginal cost under normal operations. It may have higher steps corresponding to amounts it could
            produce at higher marginal cost by introducing extra shifts or switching production from other types of
            bread. It will produce the maximum number of loaves it can make at a marginal cost below the prevailing
            market price.
          </p>
          <p>
            To find the market supply curve, we just add up the total amount that all the bakeries will supply at each
            price. Figure 8.9 shows how to do this, starting with the quantity produced at lowest marginal cost, and
            successively adding further quantities in order of increasing marginal production cost.

            The supply curve tells us two different things. If we choose any price, it tells us the total number of
            loaves the bakeries would produce. But to construct it, we plotted the marginal cost of each loaf of bread
            in increasing order of marginal costs. So, if we choose a particular quantity (7,000, say) and use the curve
            to find the corresponding value on the vertical axis (€2.74), this tells us that the marginal cost of the
            7,000th loaf is €2.74. In other words, the market supply curve is the marginal cost curve for all the bread
            produced in the city.

                Type A is more efficient than Type B: for example, as shown, at the output of 10 units, the Type A firms
                have a marginal cost of $1, as opposed to a marginal cost of $1.50 for the Type B firms. There are 10
                Type A firms and 8 Type B firms in the market. Based on this information, read the following statements
                and choose the correct option(s).

                  At $1, Type A firms supply 20 units, while Type B firms choose to supply 0 units, as their marginal
                  cost is above $1 for all quantities. So the market supply is (10 × 20) + (8 × 0) = 200.

              In our model of competitive equilibrium in a city with many small bakeries and many consumers, the
              marginal cost (MC) for each bakery is a step function: marginal cost is constant until normal capacity is
              reached. Beyond that, marginal cost is higher: the function steps up to a higher level. Bakeries differ in
              their marginal costs, and each one produces the maximum number of loaves it can make at a marginal cost
              below the prevailing market price, \(P\). Adding up the total amount at each price gives us the market
              supply curve.
            </p>
            <p>
              Now consider a bakery with cost function, \(C(Q)\); we assume quantity \(Q\) is a continuous variable and
              obtain the marginal cost by differentiating:
            </p>
            \[\text{MC}=C'(Q)\]
            <p>
              Suppose that the cost function is also convex: \(C''(Q)&gt;0\). Then, marginal cost increases with
              quantity: MC is an upward-sloping line. We showed in Extension 7.6 that in this case, the firm’s average
              cost (AC) and isoprofit curves are U-shaped, and the MC curve passes through the minimum point of each
              one.
            </p>
            <div class="sidenote">
              <p>
                The cost function in Figure 8.1 is \(C(Q)= F+a_1Q+a_2Q^2+a_3Q^3\), where \(F=35, a_1=1, a_2=0.00203\),
                and \(a_3 =0.00002\). If you wish, you can find the MC and AC curves algebraically and check their
                properties.

            <p>
              In a competitive equilibrium, the bakery is a price-taker. If the market price is \(P\), how many loaves
              of bread should the bakery supply? Its profit is a function of quantity, \(Q\):
            </p>
            \[\Pi (Q)= PQ-C(Q)\]
            <p>
              We can find the value of \(Q\) that maximizes profit by differentiating, and setting the derivative equal
              to zero to obtain the first-order condition:
            </p>
            \[\frac{d\Pi}{dQ}= P-C'(Q) = 0 \Rightarrow P = C'(Q)\]
            <p>
              This is an important result: when the firm is a price-taker, it chooses its quantity, \(Q\), so that the
              marginal cost is equal to the market price.
            </p>
            <p>
              You can check, by finding the second derivative of profit, that the point where \(P = C'(Q)\) is a maximum
              point.
            </p>
            <p>
              Figure E8.2 demonstrates the same result using the graphical approach to profit maximization that we
              followed in Unit 7. In a competitive market, the bakery cannot choose a price above the market price
              because it would not attract any customers. So if the market price is \(P^*\), its feasible frontier is
              the line \(P = P^*\) and its feasible set is the shaded area below it. To achieve maximum profit, it
              should find the point in the feasible set that reaches the highest isoprofit curve—that is, a tangency
              point with the line \(P = P^*\).
            </p>
            <p>
              The slope of the isoprofit curve at the tangency point is zero. And since we know the marginal cost curve
              passes through the minimum points of all the the isoprofit curves, the profit-maximizing point must lie on
              the marginal cost curve: it satisfies the condition \(P^* = C'(Q^*)\).

              the marginal cost function tells us how many loaves the firm will supply at any given price. If the
              equilibrium price changes, the firm will move to a different point on its marginal cost curve.
            </p>
            <p>
              If we rearrange the equation, \(P = C'(Q)\), to write \(Q\) in terms of \(P\), we obtain the direct supply
              function: the value, \(Q\), that the firm will choose for a given value of \(P\). We will write the firm’s
              supply function as:
            </p>
            \[Q=S(P)\]
            <p>where \(Q=S(P)\) is the inverse of the marginal cost function, \(P=C'(Q)\).</p>
            <h3 id="the-market-supply-function">The market supply function</h3>
            <p>
              Suppose the total number of bakeries in the market is \(m\). We will now write \(Q^i=S^i(P)\) for the
              supply function of the \(i{^t}{^h}\) bakery, for \(i=1, \ldots, m\), \(Q\), and \(Q=S(P)\) for the market
              supply function (the total quantity of bread supplied to the market by all the bakeries together).
            </p>
            <p>
              When the market price is \(P\), the total amount of bread supplied to the market is the sum of the amounts
              \(Q^i\) supplied by each bakery. So the market supply is:
            </p>
            \[Q= S(P) \text{ where } S(P)=\sum_{i = 1}^m S^i (P)\]
            <p>
              In Figure E8.3, we have drawn the supply functions for an example in which there are 50 bakeries (\(m =
              50\)) with identical upward-sloping supply functions, so that \(S(P)= 50 \times S^i(P)\). The supply
              function, \(S^i(P)\), for an individual bakery is shown on the left, and the total market supply,
              \(S(P)\), is on the right. The curves appear to have exactly the same shape. But they are drawn using
              different scales; the quantity of loaves supplied at each price, on the horizontal axis, is 50 times as
              high in the right-hand panel. If we drew them on the same scale, the market diagram would be 50 times as
              wide so the market supply curve would be much flatter (more elastic). The increase in price for each extra
              loaf produced is much lower on the market supply curve.

              Just as in the case in the main part of this section, where the individual bakeries’ marginal costs are
              step functions, the market supply curve here can be interpreted as the marginal cost curve for the market
              as a whole. This is true whether or not the bakeries have the same marginal cost function. At any given
              price, each bakery chooses to produce a quantity where the marginal cost is equal to the price. So at the
              total market quantity, the cost of one more loaf would be the same, whichever bakery produced it.
            </p>
            <h3 id="equilibrium-in-the-bread-market">Equilibrium in the bread market</h3>
            <p>
              If we know the supply and demand functions for any market, we can find the competitive equilibrium price
              and quantity graphically at the point where they cross, as in Figure 8.11 in the main part of this
              section.
            </p>
            <p>
              We can find the equilibrium mathematically by solving a pair of simultaneous equations—the market supply
              and demand curves—for the equilibrium values of \(P\) and \(Q\).
            </p>
            <p>
              If the demand and supply curves are expressed in terms of the direct demand and supply functions,
              \(Q=S(P)\) and \(Q=D(P)\), we can start by finding an equilibrium price—that is, a price that clears the
              market, equalizing the quantities demanded and supplied. The equilibrium price satisfies the equation:
            </p>
            \[S(P)=D(P)\]
            <div class="sidenote">
              <p>
                If instead you start from the indirect supply function, in which price, \(P\), equals marginal cost,
                which is a function of \(Q\), you can find the equilibrium quantity first, by substituting for \(P\) in
                the demand function.
              </p>
            </div>
            <p>
              The demand curve is downward-sloping; that is to say, \(D(P)\) is a strictly decreasing function. Then, if
              \(S(P)\) is a strictly increasing function (like the one shown in Figure E8.3, and also in Figure 8.10 in
              the main part of this section), there is at most one equilibrium price (one crossing point). Having found
              the equilibrium price by solving this equation, the equilibrium quantity may be found by substituting the
              equilibrium price back into the supply or demand equation.
            </p>
            <p>
              Remember that the slope of the supply function comes from the cost function: market supply is
              upward-sloping if marginal costs increase with quantity. What happens when all firms have the same,
              constant, marginal cost? As discussed in Section 8.7, this is what we might expect to happen in the long
              run when firms are able to increase capacity, and enter or leave the market. All firms in the market will
              have the same marginal cost, and no fixed costs. In this case, the market supply curve is flat at a price,
              \(P_0\), equal to the marginal cost.
            </p>
            <p>
              If the supply curve is flat, you can’t interpret it as saying: ‘If the price is \(P\) then the quantity
              supplied is \(Q(P)’\). Instead, we can say that for any price less than \(P_0\) the quantity supplied is
              zero and for any price greater than \(P_0\) the quantity supplied is undefined. (Technically it is
              infinite, but we would assume as a practical matter that the flat supply curve would eventually hit some
              kind of quantity constraints.)
            </p>
            <p>
              But a flat supply curve presents no problems for finding the market equilibrium. The supply and demand
              curve are \(P=P_0\) and \(Q=S(P)\). Solving them simultaneously is straightforward: the equilibrium price
              and quantity are \(P=P_0\) and \(Q=D(P_0)\). Market supply determines the price, and the demand determines
              the quantity.
            </p>
            <p>
              You may be wondering what happens for the case in which costs decrease with quantity. The answer is that
              decreasing average costs (whether arising from fixed costs, or decreasing marginal costs) limit
              competition, as discussed in Section 7.11. Markets for goods with decreasing average costs cannot be in
              competitive equilibrium—they do not satisfy the conditions we used to derive the competitive market supply
              curve, \(S(P)\). Different models are required to analyse these cases.
