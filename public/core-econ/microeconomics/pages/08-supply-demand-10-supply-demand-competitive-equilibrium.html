<h2 id="810-supply-demand-and-competitive-equilibrium-is-this-a-good-model">8.10 Supply, demand, and competitive equilibrium: Is this a good model?</h2>
<p>To model markets with many buyers and sellers, we started with supply and demand curves, telling us how much of the good sellers supply and buyers demand at any given price, and found the market-clearing price. Then we argued that:</p>
<!--index:

<ul>
  <li>the market-clearing price is a <em>competitive equilibrium</em>, because no one can benefit from asking or offering a different price, and</li>
  <li>when the market is not in competitive equilibrium, buyers and sellers will <em>adjust prices and quantities</em> in pursuit of rents, until the equilibrium is reached.</li>
</ul>

    <li>The market clears (supply equals demand).</li>

<dt class="definition-term">Law of One Price</dt><dd class="definition-description">The Law of One Price states that in equilibrium, identical goods or services will be traded at the same price by all buyers and sellers.</dd>
</dl>
<p>This model is widely used in economics. To decide whether it can be applied to the case of a particular market, we should consider whether conditions in the market resemble the theoretical conditions required for a competitive equilibrium.</p>
<h3 id="conditions-for-competitive-equilibrium">Conditions for competitive equilibrium</h3>
<p>The theoretical requirements for a market to be in competitive equilibrium are as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li>many buyers and sellers, all acting independently</li>
  <li>identical (homogeneous) goods</li>
  <li>all the buyers and sellers are aware of the prices at which others are trading</li>
  <li>buyers and sellers always seek the best price available.</li>
</ul>
<p>If these conditions hold, then at the market-clearing price, competition between sellers and between buyers will ensure that no one will trade at any other price—that is to say, they will be price-takers and the market will be in competitive equilibrium.</p>
<dl class="definition">

  <li>Many goods are differentiated in some way; reducing the intensity of competition.</li>
  <li>Buyers are not always so well informed and responsive to prices that they choose the lowest available, and hence force sellers to compete. If it takes time and effort to check prices, consumers may decide to buy as soon as they find something suitable, rather than continuing to search.</li>

<p>Although the theoretical conditions for <strong data-term="perfect competition">perfect competition</strong> rarely hold, competitive equilibrium provides a useful benchmark because it generates the maximum total surplus available in the market. The conditions for competitive equilibrium point us towards market characteristics that we would expect to favour competition and lead to beneficial outcomes. The previous section gave an example of how increasing the number of firms in a market destroyed a cartel, leading to lower prices. From <a href="/core-econ/07-firm-and-customers-09-firms-differentiate-products.html" class="show-page-number">Unit 7</a>, we know that firms face more competition and have less market power when close substitutes are available for their product.</p>

Monopoly board game

<p>With the arrival of online shopping, economists hypothesized that retail markets would be more competitive: consumers would easily be able to check the prices of many suppliers before deciding to buy. But even in this environment, consumers are not so sensitive to prices that they force firms to sell at the same price.<sup id="fnref:9" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> According to a price comparison site, <a href="https://tinyco.re/7652221" class="show-url">BoardGamePrices</a>, for board games, Monopoly—made by only one producer but sold by many retailers—was available from UK online retailers in May 2022 at prices ranging from £20.59 to £37.20 (including shipping within the UK).</p>

  <p>Test the Law of One Price for yourself, by checking online prices for a product that should be the same wherever you buy it—such as a book, game, or household appliance.

competitive equilibrium model
-->
<h3 id="where-the-model-of-competitive-equilibrium-can-be-applied">Where the model of competitive equilibrium can be applied</h3>
<p>There are markets where conditions are close to those required for intense competition and price-taking. Agricultural products such as wheat, rice, coffee, or tomatoes have many buyers and sellers, and are relatively homogeneous. Goods are not truly identical, and it is unlikely that everyone is aware of all prices. But it is nevertheless clear that they have very little power to affect the price at which they trade. So the supply and demand model helps us to understand the market for quinoa, and for cotton in the American Civil War.</p>
<p>In other cases—where there are small differences in the quality or characteristics of goods—there may be enough competition that firms’ demand curves are elastic and the range of feasible prices is narrow. Then we can assume price-taking as an approximation, to obtain a simple model of the market: for example, in retail goods and services, where many small shops sell very similar products that consumers buy regularly—such as a loaf of bread, or a cup of coffee.</p>
<p>A simplified model can provide useful predictions when the underlying assumptions are only approximately true. In the example of the 1970s oil market, the OPEC sellers did not act independently. They had considerable market power, which enabled them to restrict supply and raise the market price. However, the price was still determined at the point where demand met the (restricted) supply curve, and was equal to marginal cost, so we were able to use the supply and demand model to understand the outcome. Judging whether or not conclusions about the real world can be drawn from a simplified model is an important skill of economic analysis.</p>

  <p>Léon Walras (1834–1910) was a founder of the neoclassical school of economics. He was an indifferent student, and twice failed the entrance exam to the École Polytechnique in Paris, one of the most prestigious universities in his native France. He studied engineering at the École des Mines de Paris instead. Eventually his father, an economist, convinced him to take up the challenge of making economics into a science.</p>
  <p>The pure economic science to which he aspired was the study of relationships among things, not people, and he had notable success in eliminating human relationships from his modelling. ‘The pure theory of economics,’ he wrote, ‘resembles the physico-mathematical sciences in every respect.’</p>
  <p>His device for simplifying the economy so that it could be expressed mathematically was to represent interactions among economic agents as if they were relationships among inputs and outputs, and to focus entirely on the economy in equilibrium. In the process, the entrepreneur, a key actor in wealth creation from the Industrial Revolution to today, simply disappeared from Walrasian economics:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><span class="tighten-10">Assuming equilibrium, we may even go so far as to abstract from entrepreneurs and simply consider the productive services as being, in a certain sense, exchanged directly for one another … (<em>Elements of Theoretical Economics</em>, 1874)<sup id="fnref:10" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> </span></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Walras represented basic economic relationships as equations, which he used to study the workings of an entire economy composed of many interlinked markets. Prior to Walras, most economists had considered these markets in isolation: they would have studied, for example, how the price of textiles is determined on the cloth market, or land rents on the land market.</p>
  <!--index:
general equilibrium theory
-->
  <p>Walras created what is now called general equilibrium theory, a mathematical model of an entire economy in which all markets are in competitive equilibrium. His work was the basis of the proof, much later, of the invisible hand theorem, giving the conditions under which such an equilibrium is Pareto efficient.</p>
  <!--index:

  <p>Walras defended the right to private property, but to help the working poor, he also advocated the nationalization of land and the elimination of taxes on wages.</p>

<p>Seven years after Walras died, his general equilibrium model played an important role in the debate about the feasibility and desirability of centralized economic planning compared to a market economy. In 1917, the Bolshevik Revolution in Russia put the economics of socialism and central planning on the agenda of many economists, but surprisingly, it was the defenders of central planning, not the advocates of the market, who used Walras’s insights to make their points.</p>
<!--index:
Hayek, Friedrich
Hayek, Friedrich \\ *The Meaning of Competition*
-->
<p>Friedrich Hayek, and other defenders of market competition, criticized the general equilibrium model. They argued that by ignoring the fact that a capitalist economy is constantly changing, and therefore also the contribution of entrepreneurship and creativity, Walras had missed the true virtues of the market.</p>
<p>In Hayek’s view, the concept of a competitive equilibrium with price-taking did not capture what was important about competition. ‘The modern theory of competitive equilibrium,’ he wrote, ‘<em>assumes</em> the situation to exist which a true explanation ought to account for as the effect of the competitive process.’</p>
<p>Defining competition as ‘the action of endeavouring to gain what another endeavours to gain at the same time’, he argued:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Now, how many of the devices adopted in ordinary life to that end would still be open to a seller in a market in which so-called ‘perfect competition’ prevails? I believe that the answer is exactly none. Advertising, undercutting, and improving (‘differentiating’) the goods or services produced are all excluded by definition—‘perfect’ competition means indeed the absence of all competitive activities. (<a href="https://tinyco.re/1712601" class="show-url"><em>The Meaning of Competition</em></a>, 1946)</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="tighten-15">In practice, economies are a mixture of more and less competitive markets. But, as Hayek claimed, many competitive activities are more likely to be undertaken by firms with market power (as in <a href="/core-econ/07-firm-and-customers-09-firms-differentiate-products.html" class="show-page-number">Unit 7</a>), than by firms in more competitive markets.</p>
<p>A firm with a unique product will advertise (Buy Nike!) to shift the demand curve for its product to the right. But why would a single competitive firm advertise (Drink milk!)? This would shift the demand curve for all of the firms in the industry. Messages like ‘Drink milk!’ are probably paid for by an association of dairies, not by a particular one.</p>
<p>The same is true of expenditures to influence public policy. If a large firm with market power is successful in relaxing environmental regulations, then it will benefit directly. Campaigning and lobbying will be unattractive to the competitive firm because almost all the benefit will go to its competitors.</p>
<!--index:
research and development (R&D)
-->
<p>Similarly, research and development are more likely to be undertaken by firms facing less competition, because if they are successful in finding a profitable innovation, the benefits will not be lost to competitors also adopting it.</p>

  <h3 id="how-economists-learn-from-facts-fishing-for-perfect-competition"><strong>How economists learn from facts</strong> Fishing for perfect competition</h3>
  <p class="loosen-15">From the early nineteenth century, the catches of Atlantic fishermen landed in the port of New York were sold to restaurants and retailers at the Fulton Fish Market. It is still the largest market for fresh fish in the US, although fish are now brought in by road or air. Dealers do not display prices. Instead, the market works by pairwise trading: customers can inspect the fish and ask for a price before making their decision.</p>
  <!--index:
Graddy, Kathryn
Fulton Fish Market
-->
  <p class="tighten-15">Kathryn Graddy, an economist who specializes in how prices are set, studied the Fulton Fish Market. There were about 35 dealers, with stalls close to each other, so customers could easily observe the quantity and quality of fish available and ask several dealers for a price. She collected details of 3,357 sales of whiting by one dealer, including price, quantity, and quality of fish, and characteristics of the buyers.<sup id="fnref:11" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> <sup id="fnref:12" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote" rel="footnote">4</a></sup></p>
  <p>Of course, prices were not the same for every transaction: quality varied, and fish supplies changed from day to day. But her surprising observation was that, on average, Asian buyers paid about 7% less per pound than white buyers. (All of the dealers were white.) There seemed to be no differences between the transactions with white and Asian buyers that could explain the different prices. Watch our interview with Graddy to find out how she collected her data, and what she discovered about the model of competitive equilibrium.</p>
