            How can we explain the change from a world in which living conditions changed little unless there was an
            epidemic or a war, to the world of continuous technological revolution—in which each generation was
            noticeably, and predictably, better off than the previous one?
          </p>
          <p class="tighten-15">
            An important part of our answer is what we call the capitalist revolution: the emergence in the eighteenth
            century and eventual global spread of a way of organizing the economy that we now call capitalism. The term
            ‘capitalism’ was barely heard of a century ago, but Figure 1.13 illustrates how its use has skyrocketed
            since then. It shows the fraction of articles in the <em>New York Times</em> (excluding the sports section)
            that include the word ‘capitalism’.

            In everyday language, the word ‘capitalism’ is used in different ways, partly because people have strong
            feelings about it. In the language of economics, we use the term in a precise way: we define
            <strong data-term="capitalism">capitalism</strong> as an
            <strong data-term="economic system">economic system</strong> characterized by a particular combination of
            <strong data-term="institution">institutions</strong>. An economic system is a way of organizing the
            production and distribution of goods and services in an entire economy. And by institutions, we mean the
            various sets of laws and social customs regulating production and distribution.
          </p>
          <p>The institutions that characterize capitalism are private property, markets, and firms.</p>
          <p class="loosen-15">
            Since most of us live in capitalist economies, it is easy to overlook the importance of institutions that
            are fundamental for capitalism to work well. They are so familiar that we hardly notice them. Before seeing
            how these institutions combine in the capitalist economic system, we need to define them.

            Over the course of human history, the extent of
            <strong data-term="private property">private property</strong> has varied. In some societies, such as that
            of our distant ancestors, the hunter-gatherers, almost nothing except personal ornaments and clothing was
            owned by individuals. In others, crops and animals were private property, but land was not. The right to use
            the land was granted to families by consensus among members of a group, or by a chief, without allowing the
            family to sell the plot.
          </p>
          <p>In various economic systems, some human beings—as enslaved people—could be private property.</p>
          <p>
            Private property may be owned by an individual, a family, a business, or some entity other than the
            government. Some things that we value are not private property: for example, the air we breathe and most of
            the knowledge we use cannot be owned or bought and sold.

              Reciprocity. The transfer of a good on a market is reciprocated: unlike gifts and theft, one person’s
              transfer of a good or service to another is directly matched by a transfer in the other direction (either
              of another good or service as in barter exchange, or money, or a promise of a later transfer when buying
              on credit).
            </li>
            <li>
              Participation is voluntary. All transfers are willingly undertaken, because the things being exchanged are
              private property and both buyer and seller expect to benefit: there are mutual

              Competition. In most cases buyers and sellers are limited in the prices they can set. A seller charging a

            But private property and markets alone do not define capitalism. In many places they were important
            institutions long before capitalism. The most recent of the three components making up the capitalist
            economy is the <strong data-term="firm">firm</strong>.
          </p>
          <p>
            The kinds of firms that make up a capitalist economy include restaurants, banks, large farms that pay others
            to work there, industrial establishments, supermarkets, and internet service providers. Other productive
            organizations that are not firms, and which play a lesser role in a capitalist economy, include family
            businesses, in which most or all of the people working are family members; non-profit organizations;
            employee-owned cooperatives; and government-owned entities (such as railways and power or water companies).
            These are not firms, either because they do not make a profit, or because the owners are not private
            individuals who own the assets of the firm and employ others to work there.

            Figure 1.14 shows that the three parts of the definition of a capitalist economic system are nested
            concepts. The left-hand circle describes an economy of isolated families who own their tools and the goods
            they produce, but have little or no exchange with others.
          </p>
          <p>
            Historically, economies like the left-hand circle have existed, but have been much less important than a
            system in which markets and private property are combined (the middle circle). Private property is an
            essential condition for the operation of markets: buyers will not want to pay for goods unless they can have
            the right to own them. In the middle circle, most production is done either by individuals (shoemakers or
            blacksmiths, for example) or in families (for example, on a farm) rather than by firms with owners and
            employees. Prior to 1600, most of the economies of the world worked like this. Where firms, meaning
            employment for wages, existed, they played only a minor role.
          </p>
          <p>
            In a capitalist system, which in Britain expanded during the seventeenth and later centuries, most
            production takes place in firms. Firms combine inputs—including equipment, raw materials, and labour—to
            produce outputs. Markets and private property are essential for firms to function for two reasons.

            In other societies, private firms and markets have been relatively unimportant. The government has been the
            institution that owns capital goods, thereby controlling production, and deciding how goods should be
            distributed, and to whom. This is called a centrally planned economic system. It existed, for example, in
            the Soviet Union, East Germany, and many other eastern European countries prior to the end of Communist
            Party rule in the early 1990s.

            Another contrast is with a slave economy: an economic system where most of the work is done by people who
            are not hired for wages but, instead, like the land on which they work, are the property of another person.
          </p>
          <p>
            Though governments and families are essential parts of the workings of every economy, most economies today
            are capitalist according to our definition: they share the three characteristics of private property,
            markets, and firms. How these institutions of capitalism combine with each other and with families,
            governments, and other institutions differs greatly across countries—so it would be more precise to describe
            capitalism not as a specific economic system, but as a class of systems.
          </p>
          <h3 id="capitalism-power-and-competition">Capitalism, power, and competition</h3>
          <p>
            Capitalism is an economic system that combines centralization with decentralization. It concentrates power
            in the hands of owners and managers of firms who are then able to secure the cooperation of large numbers of
            employees in the production process. But it limits the powers of owners and of other individuals, because
            they face competition to buy and sell in markets.
          </p>
          <p>
            So when the owner of a firm interacts with an employee, the owner is ‘the boss’. But when the same owner
            interacts with a potential customer they are simply another person trying to make a sale, in competition
            with other firms. It is this combination of competition among firms, and concentration of power and
            cooperation within them, that accounts for capitalism’s success as an economic system.
          </p>
          <!--index:
capitalism \\ and power

-->
          <p>
            A striking characteristic of firms, distinguishing them from families and governments, is how quickly they
            can be born, expand, contract, and die. A successful firm can grow from just a few employees to a global
            company with hundreds of thousands of customers, that employs thousands of people, in a few years. Firms can
            do this because they are able to hire additional employees on the labour market, and attract funds to
            finance the purchase of the capital goods they need to expand production.
          </p>
          <p>
            Firms can die in a few years too. A firm that does not make profits will not have enough money (and will not
            be able to borrow money) to continue employing and producing. The firm shrinks, and some of the employees
            lose their jobs.
          </p>
          <p>
            Contrast this with a successful family farm. The family will be better off than its neighbours; but unless
            it turns the family farm into a firm, and employs other people to work on it, expansion will be limited. If,
            instead, the family is not very good at farming, then it will simply be less well off than its neighbours.
            The family head cannot dismiss the children as a firm might get rid of unproductive workers. As long as the
            family can feed itself, there is no equivalent mechanism to a firm’s failure that will automatically put it
            out of business.
          </p>
          <p>
            Government bodies also tend to be more limited in their capacity to expand if successful, and are usually
            protected from failure if they perform poorly.

            As we have seen, the continuous technological revolution coincided with the transition to firms as the
            predominant means of organizing production. This does not mean that firms necessarily caused technological
            change. But firms competing with each other in markets had strong incentives to adopt and develop new and
            more productive technologies, and to invest in capital goods that would have been beyond the reach of
            small-scale family enterprises.

              Adam Smith also recognized some drawbacks of specialization: ‘The man whose whole life is spent in
              performing a few simple operations, has no occasion to exert his understanding or to exercise his
              invention. He naturally loses, therefore, the habit of such exertion, and generally becomes as stupid and
              ignorant as it is possible for a human creature to become.’

            <p>
              You can read about his concerns in the article,

          <p>
            The growth of firms employing large numbers of workers—and the expansion of markets linking the entire world
            in a process of exchange—allowed historically unprecedented specialization in the tasks and products on
            which people worked. As Adam Smith explained, organizing production so that workers specialize in different
            tasks enables firms to increase output with the same number of employees.
