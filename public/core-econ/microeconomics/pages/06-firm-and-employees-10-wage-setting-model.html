              Employers face a labour discipline problem when they need to give employees an incentive to ensure that
              they work hard and well. In the labour discipline model, they do this by setting wages that include an
              economic rent (employment rent), which will be lost if the job is terminated.

            How can the firm set the wage to address both of these concerns? In general, the wage required to hire
            enough workers to achieve a particular level of employment will not be high enough to motivate them to work
            hard.

              The reservation wage is the lowest wage a worker is willing to accept to take up a new job. It is the wage
              available in the worker’s next best job option (the reservation option). For workers whose next best
              option is unemployment, the reservation wage takes into account the wages they expect to receive when they
              find a new job as well as any income received while unemployed.

            We will consider the example of the Parisian language school (introduced in
            <a href="/core-econ/06-firm-and-employees-05-reservation-wage-curve.html" class="show-page-number"
              >Section 6.5</a
            >), which employs young graduates to teach short courses in French for visiting students. Figure 6.10 shows
            the school’s reservation wage curve, which tells us the wage required to employ <em>N</em> workers.
            Potential tutors only accept a job offer if the wage is above their
            <strong data-term="reservation wage">reservation wage</strong>, and have different reservation wages
            according to their individual utility of unemployment. So to recruit and retain more employees, the school
            has to increase the wage.
          </p>
          <p>
            For example, if the wage is €650, its potential recruits are limited to those with reservation wages less
            than or equal to €650, and the maximum number of tutors it can employ is 40. If it raises the wage to €700,
            it can also attract tutors with reservation wages between €650 and €700, increasing employment to 60.

            If the school sets a wage €650 and employs 40 tutors, its employees will have reservation wages between €550
            and €650. But it also wants them to work hard—effective teaching requires careful preparation—and it is

            Consider the case of Marc, a tutor whose reservation wage is equal to €650. He will not choose to work hard
            if the wage is €650, because he will be indifferent between being employed while exerting no effort, and his
            next best option, unemployment. To give an employee an incentive to work hard, the wage must be above their
            reservation wage: firstly to compensate them for the cost of effort, and secondly to ensure that losing the
            job is costly for them. In other words, they must receive an

            The rent required to deter shirking depends on two things: the cost of effort, <em>c</em>, and the number of
            weeks, <em>s</em>, that a shirker could expect to remain in the job before being caught. For a tutor with

            We will suppose that for each tutor, the cost of effort amounts to €25 per week, and the required rent is
            equal to €35 per week. Then the no-shirking wage is:

          <p>
            In Figure 6.11, we have plotted the no-shirking wage curve €60 above the reservation wage curve. If we think
            of potential tutors as lined up in order of their reservation wages, Marc, with reservation wage €650, is
            the 40th, and Françoise, whose reservation wage is €600, is the 20th. In each case, their no-shirking wage
            is €60 above their reservation wage.

            What can the school do if it wants to employ 40 tutors? A wage of €650 is enough to recruit them, but then
            Marc, Françoise, and more than half of the others have no incentive to work because the wage is below their
            no-shirking wage.
          </p>
          <p>Figure 6.11 suggests that to ensure that none of them shirk, the school should set the wage at €710.</p>
          <p class="loosen-9">
            But there is one more problem: if the school offered €710, some workers with reservation wages higher than
            Marc would accept the offer. But they would shirk, because their no-shirking wage is above €710. To overcome
            this problem, the firm will need to interview its applicants to find out more about them, and make offers
            only to those it expects to work hard—that is, the ones with reservation wages below €650.
          </p>
          <p>
            The importance for individual firms and workers of learning more about each other before they commit
            themselves to an employment contract is one of the reasons that matching in the labour market takes time and
            effort. In practice, firms hold interviews for most jobs. Assessing who is likely to work hard may be
            difficult, but in this simple model we will assume that our firm can screen applicants perfectly.
          </p>
          <p>
            Then, the no-shirking line in Figure 6.11 tells us the lowest wage the school can set if it wants to employ
            a given number of workers and ensure that they work hard. To employ 40 non-shirking workers, it could set a
            wage of €710, and screen applicants to recruit only those who will work hard at this wage.

            But it could set a higher wage. If the school chose a wage of €730, there would be more applicants for each
            vacancy, but it could choose only to hire enough to maintain employment at 40. Figure 6.12 shows the

            If the school’s owners want to make as much profit as possible, what wage should they set? To answer this
            question they need to consider how profit depends on <em>N</em> and <em>w</em>.

          <p class="keep-with-next">A firm’s profits are equal to sales revenue minus input costs.</p>
          <p>
            Suppose that each tutor generates revenue of <em>y</em> = €800 per week for the school in student fees. To
            keep the model simple, assume that wages are the school’s only input cost. Then if <em>N</em> tutors are
            employed at wage <em>w</em>, the net profit from employing each tutor is 800 – <em>w</em>, and the school’s
            total profit is:
          </p>
          \[\begin{align*} \text{profit per week}&amp;=(y-w) \times N\\ &amp;=(800-w)N \end{align*}\]
          <p>
            As long as the wage is below €800, it will make a profit. The lower the wage, <em>w</em>, and the larger the
            number, <em>N</em>, of tutors employed, the more profit it will make.

            We can represent profit in a diagram by finding different combinations of <em>w</em> and <em>N</em> that
            give the same amount of profit. For example, with <em>N</em> = 10 and <em>w</em> = €650, profit = €1,500.
            Other ways to obtain profit of €1,500 would be <em>N</em> = 40 and <em>w</em> = €762.50, or <em>N</em> = 75
            and <em>w</em> = €780. In Figure 6.13, we have drawn a curve joining these three points with all the other
            combinations of <em>N</em> and <em>w</em> that give €1,500 of profit. This is called an

            Figure 6.13 to understand how other isoprofit curves can be drawn.

            We could describe the isoprofit curves as the firm’s
            <strong data-term="indifference curve">indifference curves</strong>: the firm is indifferent between
            combinations of <em>w</em> and <em>N</em> giving the same level of profit. Isoprofit curves have the
            following characteristics:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <em>They slope upward:</em> If you start at point A, for example, and then increase the number of workers,
              you do not need as much profit per worker to keep total profit constant. Therefore you can raise the wage.
            </li>
            <li>
              <em>They have higher levels of profit towards the bottom right of the diagram</em>, where <em>N</em> is
              high and <em>w</em> is low.
            </li>
            <li>
              <em>They all have a similar curved shape:</em> They are steep when <em>N</em> and <em>w</em> are both low,
              and quite flat when <em>N</em> and <em>w</em> are both high.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            To understand the last property, consider what happens when you increase the number of workers, <em>N</em>,
            by one. How much do you have to change the wage to stay on the same isoprofit curve—that is, to make the
            same profit as before? Figure 6.14 shows this calculation for two points on the 1,500 isoprofit curve. When
            <em>w</em> and <em>N</em> are low, you make a lot of profit on the additional worker, and you have to
            increase <em>w</em> a lot to offset this extra profit: the slope of the curve is high. When <em>w</em> and
            <em>N</em> are high, profit on the extra worker is low and you don’t have to adjust the wage as much.

          <p>Our model of wage setting tells us the following:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              The number of workers a firm can employ depends on its wage, and the reservation wages of potential
              employees (the reservation wage curve). To increase employment it needs to raise the wage, in order to
              recruit employees with higher reservation wages.

              The firm chooses a wage on the no-shirking wage curve, which lies above the reservation wage curve. The
              difference between the two is the cost of effort, and the employment rent required to deter shirking.

            In this model, the firm faces a trade-off: to employ more workers it has to raise wages. As long as the wage
            is less than €800, the language school makes a profit on each tutor employed—so it would like to employ
            more. But then it would have to raise the wage, reducing the profit on every tutor. Restraining employment
            keeps the wage down, enabling it to make a high profit on each employee. The firm’s ability to control wages
            in this way is called <strong data-term="labour market power">labour market power</strong>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our model of wage setting demonstrates how firms can set wages both to recruit and retain workers, and to
            provide them with an incentive to work hard. In the next section, we will examine the implications: how
            wages and employment are affected when economic conditions change.

              <p>
                In the main part of this section we used diagrams to show how a firm (the language school) would set its
                wage, \(w\), and a corresponding level of employment, \(N\). Its profit-maximizing combination of \(w\)
                and \(N\) lies at the point where the no-shirking wage curve is tangent to an isoprofit curve. In this
                extension, we show how to do this by using calculus to solve a constrained choice problem. The method we
                use is explained in <a href="https://tinyco.re/4704296" class="show-url">Extension 3.5</a>, which you

              The firm’s total profit is equal to the number of workers, \(N\), multiplied by the net profit on each

            <h3 id="the-properties-of-isoprofit-curves">The properties of isoprofit curves</h3>
            <p>The equation of the isoprofit curve corresponding to a particular level of profit, \(Π_0\), is:</p>
            \[(y - w)N = \Pi_0\]
            <p>
              We can work out the shape of the isoprofit curves by examining the algebraic properties of this equation.
              Since the graph is drawn with \(w\) on the vertical axis, it is helpful to rearrange the equation to
              obtain:
            </p>
            \[w = y - \frac{\Pi_0}{N}\]
            <p>
              This equation shows that \(w\) increases with \(N\) (because \(Π_0/N\) gets smaller). We can verify this
              by differentiating:
            </p>
            \[\frac{dw}{dN} = \frac{\Pi_0}{N^2} &gt; 0\]
            <p>
              This tells us that isoprofit curves are upward-sloping. It is useful to note that the slope can be written
              in terms of <em>w</em> and <em>N</em> only by substituting back the original expression for profit, \(Π_0
              = (y-w)N\):
            </p>
            \[\frac{dw}{dN} = \frac{(y - w)N}{N^2} = \frac{(y - w)}{N}\]
            <p>
              This second way of writing the slope shows us how it varies in different parts of the diagram without
              having to work out the level of profit at different points: the curves are flatter towards the top right,
              where \(N\) and \(w\) are both high.
            </p>
            <p>
              Returning to the previous expression, we can determine the second derivative, which shows that as we move
              along an isoprofit curve the slope, \(dw/dN\) decreases—the curve gets flatter—as \(N\) increases:
            </p>
            \[\frac{d^2 w}{d N^2} = -\frac{\Pi_0}{N^3} &lt; 0\]
            <p>
              In summary, these isoprofit curves are increasing and concave, in contrast to indifference curves which
              are typically decreasing and convex (as explained in
              <a
                href="/core-econ/05-the-rules-of-the-game-04-technology-and-preferences.html#extension-54-the-properties-of-concave-production-functions-and-quasi-linear-preferences"

                >Extension 5.4</a
              >).
            </p>
            <p>
              Lastly, the isoprofit curve equation tells us that if we draw a set of isoprofit curves for different
              values of \(Π_0\), higher levels of profit correspond to lower levels of the wage at each value of \(N\).
              In other words, the curves lower down in the figure have higher profit. To verify this algebraically, we
              can partially differentiate \(w\) with respect to \(Π_0\), holding \(N\) constant:
            </p>
            \[w = y - \frac{\Pi_0}{N} \Rightarrow \frac{\partial w}{\partial \Pi_0} = -\frac{1}{N} &lt; 0\]
            <p>—that is to say, higher profit requires a lower wage at each level of employment.</p>
            <h3 id="solving-the-firms-constrained-choice-problem">Solving the firm’s constrained choice problem</h3>
            <p>
              The owners of the firm want to choose \(w\) and \(N\) from the firm’s feasible set to make the highest
              possible profit. The feasible set is the set of combinations of \(w\) and \(N\) that lie on or above the
              no-shirking wage curve.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the model we have developed in this unit, the no-shirking wage is greater than the worker’s reservation
              wage because the wage has to allow for the cost of effort, and give the worker enough rent to ensure that
              it is better to work than shirk. So the no-shirking wage curve lies above and parallel to the reservation
              wage curve, which is an upward-sloping relationship between \(w\) and \(N\). To keep the analysis of
              profit maximization more general than in the main section above, we will not assume that it is a straight
              line. We will simply assume that \(w\) is an increasing function of \(N\):
            </p>
            \[w = W(N) \text{, where } W'(N) &gt; 0\]
            <div class="sidenote">
              <p>
                The parameters are: \(m\) and \(q\), which determine the firm’s recruitment and retention (<a
                  href="https://tinyco.re/4603965"

                  >Extension 6.5</a

                  >Section 6.8</a
                >). Extension 6.8 explains how all of these fit together to form the reservation wage curve. The
                no-shirking wage also depends on \(c\), \(h\), and \(s\) which affect the incentives for working hard
                (<a href="/core-econ/06-firm-and-employees-09-labour-discipline-model.html">Section 6.9</a>).
              </p>
            </div>
            <p>
              We know that the position and slope of the no-shirking wage curve depend on a number of different labour
              market parameters. But in this extension we will keep things simple by not including these parameters
              explicitly when we write the function, \(W\)(\(N\)); we focus only on the relationship between \(w\) and
              \(N\).
            </p>
            <p>
              The firm faces a constrained choice problem of a similar form to the problem for a worker choosing
              consumption and free time to maximize utility (<a href="https://tinyco.re/4704296" class="show-url"
                >Extensions 3.5</a
              >
              and <a href="https://tinyco.re/3972058" class="show-url">5.5</a>). There is one difference, though:
              consumption and free time are both ‘goods’ for workers, so they want both to be as large as possible, and
              the indifference curves slope upward. But the firm maximizes profit when \(N\) is as large as possible,
              and \(w\) is as small as possible, so its isoprofit curves slope upward.
            </p>
            <p>
              Feasible combinations of \(w\) and \(N\) satisfy \(w ≥ W(N)\), but since the firm wants \(w\) to be as
              small as possible, we know it will choose a combination where \(w = W(N)\). So, as we did for Karim in
              <a href="https://tinyco.re/4704296">Extension 3.5</a>, we can write the constraint as an equality, rather
              than an inequality.
            </p>
            <div class="info">
              <h3 id="the-employers-constrained-choice-problem">The employer’s constrained choice problem</h3>
              <p>Choose \(w\) and \(N\) to maximize \(\Pi(w, N)\) subject to the constraint \(w=W(N)\).</p>
            </div>
            <p>
              Since the profit function has a particularly simple form, we can solve this problem easily using the
              method of substitution. Profit is:
            </p>
            \[\Pi = (y - w)N\]
            <p>and substituting for <em>w</em> using the constraint gives profit as a function of <em>N</em> only:</p>
            \[\Pi = (y - W(N))N\]
            <p>
              To find the value of <em>N</em> that maximizes profit, we differentiate with respect to <em>N</em> (using
              the product rule) and set the derivative to zero:
            </p>
            \[\frac{d \Pi}{dN} = (y - W(N)) - W'(N)N = 0\]
            <p>Rearranging this equation, we get the first-order condition:</p>
            \[W'(N) = \frac{y - W(N)}{N}\]
            <p>
              which tells us that profit is maximized at the point on the no-shirking wage curve \(w = W(N)\) where its
              slope is equal to the slope of the isoprofit curve. (We showed above that the slope of an isoprofit curve
              at any point is given by \((y \ – \ w)/N\).)
            </p>
            <p>
              If we know the explicit equation of the no-shirking wage curve, we can solve the pair of simultaneous
              equations (the first-order condition and the no-shirking wage equation) to find the particular values of
              \(w\) and \(N\) that the employer will choose. In Exercise E6.3, you can try this for the case of a linear
              no-shirking wage curve.

              We should check the second-order condition to be sure that the solution we have found is indeed a maximum
              point. Differentiating the expression for profit again gives:

            \[\frac{d^2 \Pi}{dN^2} = -2W'(N) - W''(N)\]
            <p>
              For a maximum point, the second derivative must be negative. We know that \(W\)(\(N\)) is an increasing
              function, so the first term is certainly negative. However, if it is highly concave (that is, if
              \(W’’(N)\) is a large negative number) it is possible that the second term could be sufficiently positive
              to make the second derivative positive overall. In that case, we would have found a point of minimum
              profit. So to solve this constrained choice problem for any particular no-shirking wage curve, we ought to
              check that the second-order condition holds.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you like, you can try sketching a diagram to show what happens when the no-shirking wage curve is
              highly concave. If it is sufficiently curved, the no-shirking wage curve lies <em>below</em> the isoprofit
              curve either side of the tangency point (rather than above it, as in Figure 6.16). Then, imagine yourself
              approaching the tangency point along the no-shirking wage curve from the left. As you cross the isoprofit
              curves, profit gets lower and lower—until you pass the tangency point, when it starts to rise again. The
              tangency point is a point of minimum profit.

              <p>
                Consider the linear case, where the no-shirking wage curve is given by the equation \(W = W_0 + W_1 N\)
                (where \(W_0 \text { and } W_1\) are positive constants).

                <li>
                  Find the profit-maximizing wage and employment in terms of \(W_0\) and \(W_1\). (Make sure to check
                  that the second-order condition is satisfied.)
                </li>
                <li>
                  Explain how the profit-maximizing wage and employment change if the no-shirking wage curve shifts
                  upwards.

                <li>Explain what happens if the slope of the no-shirking wage curve increases.</li>
