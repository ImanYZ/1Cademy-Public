            In this section, we will explain how the relationship between the lender and the borrower is a
            <strong data-term="principal–agent relationship, principal–agent problem">principal–agent problem</strong>
            similar in many ways to the relationship between the employer and employee studied in
            <a href="/core-econ/06-firm-and-employees-06-contracts-principals-agents.html" class="show-page-number"
              >Unit 6</a
            >. The lender is the ‘principal’ and the borrower is the ‘agent’. The principal–agent model explains why
            many people who want to borrow are not able to do so, or can only borrow limited amounts or at high interest
            rates.

            Credit market exclusion when loans may not be repaid
          </h3>
          <p>
            In the previous sections, we simplified the analysis of borrowing and lending in three ways. First, any
            loans taken on would be repaid. Second, there was a given interest rate; we did not explain where that came
            from. And third, borrowing funds was possible even for a person with no initial wealth.
          </p>
          <!--index:

-->
          <p>
            None of the three assumptions fits actual credit markets where lenders decide on the interest rate to be
            charged, loans may not be repaid, and, for that reason, some who would like to borrow are not as fortunate
            as Julia. Therefore, many prospective borrowers are either
            <strong data-term="credit market constrained">credit market constrained</strong>, that is, they:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>are limited in how much they can borrow, or</li>
            <li>
              can borrow only at very high rates of interest (like those taking out payday loans in New York at the
              beginning of the unit).
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Alternatively, they are <strong data-term="credit market excluded">credit market excluded</strong>, that is,
            they are simply unable to borrow at all.

            Figure 9.15 gives an idea of the limitations that people face in credit markets in the US (the data is for
            2019, so as to avoid the unusual difficulties faced by people during the COVID-19 pandemic). To understand
            what the figures mean, think about a person whose job is terminated. In 2019, somewhat more than one in five
            people would be unemployed for more than six months. The table shows that almost one-third of people could
            not ‘cover expenses by any means’ including borrowing, for even just three months. More than half were
            borrowing at the very high rates of interest charged on credit cards. Not surprisingly, those who were
            credit market constrained or excluded tended to be poor. But even those with substantial incomes (over
            $100,000) sometimes found that they could not borrow as much as they would have liked.

            </h3>
            <p class="keep-with-next">
              One way to estimate the prevalence of credit constraints is through surveys. This is how the US Federal
              Reserve Board got the data shown in Figure 9.15.
            </p>
            <p>
              Although useful, survey data has limitations: people may not remember their credit market experiences
              accurately and may not be able to accurately answer hypothetical questions about whether they would
              succeed in getting a loan if they attempted to borrow.
            </p>
            <div class="sidenote">
              <p>
                For an explanation of treatments and controls in experiments, read
                <a href="https://tinyco.re/3789635" class="show-url"
                  >‘How economists learn from facts: Laboratory experiments’</a
                >.
              </p>
            </div>
            <p>
              Another way to investigate credit constraints is to run experiments, in which one group is randomly
              assigned to receive an intervention (often called a ‘treatment’), with the other group not receiving the
              intervention and referred to as the control group. Because the assignment of an individual to one of the
              groups is random and because other influencing factors are held constant, average differences in behaviour
              between the groups are interpreted as <em>caused</em> by the treatment.
            </p>
            <p>
              If a person is credit constrained, being given a sum of money might change their behaviour. For example,
              they might start up a company. On the other hand, if they were not credit constrained and had thought it
              would be profitable, they would have already taken out a loan. Credit constraints can therefore be
              identified by running experiments in which some individuals are given sums of money (the treatment group),
              and others are not.

              In one experiment, the Nigerian government selected the best business plans from those that were submitted
              to them. Within this pool of the best plans, they randomly assigned some to receive a cash grant worth, on
              average, around 8 million naira (which was approximately equivalent to US$50,000 when the study was

              They could have used the grant to lend at the going interest rate, but instead they chose to expand their
              business. Before the grant, they were unable to undertake the business expansion. This implies that they
              were previously constrained in their ability to borrow. A similar experiment in Sri Lanka randomly
              assigned small businesses a grant worth 10,000 LKR (which was approximately equivalent to US$100 when the

              Experiments are often considered as a ‘gold standard’ for identifying causal effects. However, experiments
              are often difficult to implement because they can be expensive, difficult to implement logistically, and
              sometimes raise ethical questions. Because of this, economists often use ‘natural experiments’, where a
              naturally occurring event is considered ‘as good as randomly assigned’.

              In the case of credit constraints, the arrival of an unexpected inheritance can be considered as good as
              random.
            </p>
            <p>
              In Britain, it was estimated that an inheritance of approximately £5,000 (which was approximately
              equivalent to US$9,000 when the study was published) doubled young people’s likelihood of starting up a
              new business,<sup id="fnref:7" role="doc-noteref"

              implying that they were previously constrained in their ability to borrow money to do so. It has also been
              found that after receiving an inheritance, individuals are more likely to transition into self-employment
              and to increase the scale of their operations if already self-employed.<sup

              Another natural experiment that can be used to identify whether individuals are credit constrained is
              automatic increasing of borrowing limits on a credit card, after the card has been held for some time.
              Evidence from the US<sup id="fnref:9" role="doc-noteref"

              suggests that many individuals are indeed credit constrained, since an increase in their credit limits,
              which allows them to borrow more, results in them choosing to increase their borrowing.

          <p>
            Borrowing and lending is a principal–agent relationship because the lender (the principal) faces the risk of
            not being repaid, and the extent of that risk is determined by the borrower (the agent), not the lender.
          </p>
          <p>
            A loan is made now and has to be repaid in the future. Between now and then, unanticipated events beyond the
            control of the borrower can occur. If the crops in Chambar, Pakistan were destroyed by bad weather or
            disease, the moneylenders would not be repaid. If the skills you have invested in using your student loan
            become obsolete, the loan may not be repaid. Unanticipated events like these are known as
            <em>unavoidable risks</em>. The interest rate set by a bank or a moneylender would be greater if the default
            risk due to unavoidable events was greater.
          </p>
          <p>
            But lenders face two further problems. When loans are taken out for investment projects, the lender cannot
            be sure that a borrower will exert enough effort to make the project succeed. Moreover, often the borrower
            has more information than the lender about the quality of the project and its likelihood of success. Both of
            these problems arise from the difference between the information the borrower and the lender have about the
            borrower’s project and actions.
          </p>
          <p>
            Think about a borrower who secures a loan to start a new business. The project doesn’t succeed because the
            borrower made too little effort or because it just wasn’t a good project. If the borrower has not put any of
            their own money into the project, it is the lender, not the borrower, who loses money if the project fails
            and the loan is not repaid. If the borrower were using only their own money, it is likely that they would
            have been more conscientious or maybe not engaged in the project at all.
          </p>
          <p>
            The borrower may also use the borrowed funds for a much riskier project than the one that they told the
            lender they would use it for. To illustrate this (with an extreme example), they could simply buy lottery
            tickets with the money they have borrowed—if one of them pays off, they are rich; if not, the lender does
            not get repaid.
          </p>
          <p>
            Just like the employee in
            <a href="/core-econ/06-firm-and-employees-07-job-loss-cost.html" class="show-page-number">Unit 6</a>, who
            did not always act in the best interest of the employer, the borrower does not necessarily act in the best
            interest of the lender.
          </p>
          <p>
            The principal–agent problem between borrower and lender is also similar to the ‘other people’s money’
            problem which you can read about in
            <a href="/core-econ/06-firm-and-employees-03-separation-ownership-control.html" class="show-page-number"
              >Section 6.3</a
            >. In that case, the manager of a firm (the agent) makes decisions about the use of the funds supplied by
            the firm’s owners (the principals), but the owners cannot contractually require the manager to act in a way
            that maximizes the owners’ wealth, rather than pursuing the manager’s own objectives.

          <p>
            In the case of borrowing and lending, it is often not possible for the lender (the principal) to write a
            contract that ensures a loan will be repaid by the borrower (the agent). The reason is that if the project
            fails, or if the borrower is for other reasons without funds when repayment is due, it may be impossible for
            the lender to secure repayment according to the terms of the loan.
          </p>
          <p>
            Lenders will attempt to secure repayment of a loan through legal measures, but this will often be difficult
            if the borrower is poor or declares bankruptcy because the value of their debt exceeds the value of their
            assets. In the introduction to this unit, we reported
            <a href="https://tinyco.re/8492074" class="show-url">an example of a method of improving compliance</a> in
            car loan repayments—companies install devices that disable the ignition of the car if the repayments are not
            made as required.

              ‘an equitable division of the pie’.

          </dl>
          <p>
            One response of the lender to this conflict of interest in the credit market is to require the borrower to
            put some of their wealth into the project (this is called <strong data-term="equity">equity</strong>). The
            more of the borrower’s own money that is invested in the project, the more closely aligned their interests
            are with those of the lender. Another common response is to require the borrower to set aside property that
            will be transferred to the lender if the loan is not repaid (this is called
            <strong data-term="collateral">collateral</strong>).
          </p>
          <p>
            Collateral is used in loans for houses (called mortgages) and for cars. For many people (as in
            <a href="/core-econ/09-lenders-borrowers-09-principal-agent-problem.html#figure-9-15">Figure 9.15</a> for
            the US), these are the only large loans they can get, and that is because the collateral—the house or the
            car—reverts to the lender if repayments are not made. Securing a loan to cover your consumption needs during
            a period of unemployment is much more difficult because the unemployed worker is unlikely to have any
            collateral to offer.
          </p>
          <!--index:
pawnbroking
-->
          <p>
            The pawnbroker is a common example of collateral in small-scale lending and borrowing that has existed for
            thousands of years. The pawnbroker, found today on shopping streets under the slogan ‘cash converter’ or
            similar, extends a loan to the borrower with a date and amount of repayment specified. And the borrower
            turns over some item of their property to the pawnbroker, which will be returned to the borrower when the
            loan is repaid. Items commonly lodged with a pawnbroker—because they can easily be sold—include jewellery,
            laptops and other electronic equipment, cameras, or valuable household items.
          </p>
          <p class="hyphens-manual">
            A loan with collateral is called a secured loan because, as long as the collateral (the house or the pawned
            item) can readily be sold for more than the amount of money owed, the lender is secure. With a secured loan,
            the lender does not run any substantial risk.
          </p>
          <p>
            Equity or collateral reduces the conflict of interest between the borrower and the lender. The reason is
            that, when the borrower has some of their money (either equity or collateral) at stake:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <em>They have a greater interest in working hard so that the loan will be repaid</em>: They will try
              harder to make prudent business decisions to ensure the project’s success.
            </li>
            <li>
              <em>It is a signal to the lender</em>: It signals that the borrower thinks that the project is of
              sufficient quality to succeed.

            Figure 9.18 connects the labour and credit markets. It illustrates how the credit and labour markets
            influence the relationships among the groups of lenders and borrowers, and employers and employees.
          </p>
          <p>
            Starting at the upper left of the figure, wealthy individuals can use their wealth to purchase capital goods
            to become employers, and they can also lend to others. Among the less wealthy, there will be some successful
            borrowers who can, as a result, also become employers. Those with little wealth cannot borrow much: they are
            credit market excluded or can borrow only where a house provides the collateral for a mortgage, for example,
            or access limited amounts at high interest rates. They must seek work as employees. Employers hire employees
            from among the less wealthy, with some remaining unemployed (due to the workings of the labour market that
            we study in <a href="/core-econ/06-firm-and-employees-04-finding-jobs.html">Unit 6</a>).

            figure; their common red colour indicates this similarity. Agents—successful borrowers, and employees—are
            coloured green to distinguish them from would-be agents (credit market excluded and unemployed) who are
            coloured purple. Even if you are an agent lucky enough to be in one of the green boxes, the principal can
            put you back in the purple box just by refusing to deal with you. This is why lenders and employers have
            power over borrowers and employees.

            Figure 9.18 helps us understand why some people end up as principals (employers, for example) while others
            end up as agents (employees). If one is wealthy, one can be both a lender and an employer.

              <p>Read the following statements about the principal–agent problem and choose the correct option(s).</p>
              <ul class="mcq-options">
                <li>A principal–agent problem exists in the credit market if the lender may not be repaid.</li>
                <li>
                  The principal–agent problem can be resolved by writing a binding contract for the borrower to exert
                  full effort.
                </li>
                <li>
                  One solution for the principal–agent problem in the credit market is for the borrower to provide
                  equity.
                </li>
                <li>The principal–agent problem leads to credit market constraints and exclusion.</li>
              </ul>
              <ul class="mcq-feedback">
                <li>
                  A principal–agent problem exists only if there is something that the borrower may do or be that the
                  lender does not know and cannot control; not being repaid could take place even if there were no such
                  problems of asymmetric information and incomplete contract.
                </li>
                <li>The principal–agent problem exists because one cannot write a binding contract for full effort.</li>
                <li>
                  Equity implies that the agent has more to lose if the project fails, reducing the difference in the
                  incentives between the principal and the agent.
                </li>
                <li>
                  This occurs because some otherwise viable projects will not be funded owing to the principal–agent
                  problem. In particular, those with few assets or little wealth who cannot afford to put in equity or
                  provide collateral are more likely to be credit rationed because of the principal–agent problem.

                Read the following statements comparing principal–agent relationships in labour markets and credit
                markets, and choose the correct option(s).

                <li>
                  In both cases, the principal would like the agent to exert a good amount of effort, but this cannot be
                  written explicitly into the contracts.
                </li>
                <li>
                  In both cases, the duration of the relationship cannot be set as a specific time period in the written
                  contract.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The problems associated with principal–agent relationships in these markets lead to some workers being
                  excluded from employment and some borrowers being excluded from receiving credit.
                </li>
                <li>
                  In labour markets, one possible solution is for employers to require collateral from their employees.
                </li>

              <ul class="mcq-feedback">
                <li>
                  The employer would like their worker to work hard, and the lender would like the borrower to exert
                  effort in the project the funds were borrowed for. However, formal contracts cannot capture these
                  elements.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The duration of employment is often not specified in employment contracts, but the date of repayment
                  is a standard part of borrowing contracts.
                </li>
                <li>
                  One consequence in labour markets is unemployment. One consequence in credit markets is credit
                  constraints (and credit exclusion).
                </li>
                <li>
                  The use of collateral can provide a possible solution in credit markets but it does not apply in the
                  same way for labour markets.

              On Christmas Day in 2014, the <em>New York Times</em> published an article entitled
              <a href="https://tinyco.re/9099517" class="show-url">‘Rise in Loans Linked to Cars is Hurting the Poor’</a
              >.

            <p>Here are two quotes from the article:</p>
            <blockquote>
              <p>
                ‘The lenders argue that they are providing a source of credit for people who cannot obtain
                less-expensive loans from banks. The high interest rates, the lenders say, are necessary to offset the
                risk that borrowers will stop paying their bills.’
              </p>
            </blockquote>
            <blockquote>
              <p>
                ‘And because many lenders make the loan based on an assessment of a used car’s resale value, not on a
                borrower’s ability to repay that money, many people find that they are struggling to keep up almost as
                soon as they drive off with the cash.’
              </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Based on the information in the article:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                Who are the principals and the agents in this story? What are the loans being used for and what is the
                role of cars in the relationship between the principals and the agents?

            <blockquote>
              <p>
                Pawnbroking is one of the oldest sources of credit in the world. A pawnshop offers loans in exchange for
                items such as jewellery, which are held by the shop until the loan is repaid. Such shops are mainly used
                by people on low incomes. In Texas, the maximum interest rate that can be charged is 20% per month.
                According to a study of pawnshops in Texas, default rates are lower when items of sentimental value,
                such as rings, rather than items of equivalent resale value, such as TV sets, are held by the shop.
