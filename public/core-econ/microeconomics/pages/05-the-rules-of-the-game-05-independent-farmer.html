            5.5 Institutions, and the case of the independent farmer
          </h2>
          <p>
            As a starting point—our baseline case—it is helpful to think about what Angela would choose to do if she
            owned the farm herself. How many hours would she work, and how much grain would she consume? Then we
            consider three different institutional settings in which Bruno owns the land. For each case, we identify the
            total amount of grain produced, hours worked by Angela, and how much grain Angela and Bruno each get. We
            will then explore how the outcomes differ depending on the rules of the game.
          </p>
          <p>Figure 5.6 summarizes how the rules of the game differ between the cases:</p>
          <dl class="definition">

              are protected by the legal system.

            Baseline case: Private ownership by an independent producer
          </h3>
          <p>
            We begin with the case in which Angela owns the land that she farms. She chooses her own working hours, and
            consumes the grain she produces. There is no other character in this case—only Angela, so this is not a
            social interaction and the question of income distribution does not arise.
          </p>
          <h4 id="land-tenure-institutions">Land tenure institutions</h4>
          <!--index:
land ownership
-->
          <p>
            Ownership of land by individuals or households is a form of private property, meaning that the owner can
            exclude others from the use of the land or enjoyment of its products and is free to sell or give away the
            property. Private ownership is one of many land tenure institutions, that is, rules (written or informal)
            that govern who can use and buy or sell land and the conditions under which use, sale, and purchase can take
            place. Aside from private ownership, other forms of land tenure include communal tenure (for example, where
            members of a community may have the right to graze cattle on a common pasture); open access, where specific
            rights are not assigned to anyone and no-one can be excluded (such as oceans and some forests); and state
            ownership, where property rights are assigned to some authority in the public sector such as the national or
            state government.
          </p>
          <p>
            Angela’s ownership of the land means that she can exclude others from using it or from receiving any of its
            produce. The government will enforce this right if necessary, penalizing anyone who attempts to violate it.
          </p>
          <h4 id="angelas-decisions-as-an-independent-producer">Angela’s decisions as an independent producer</h4>
          <p>
            When Angela can choose how to run the farm for herself, consuming all the grain she produces, she faces a
            constrained choice problem just like the one we analyse for Karim in
            <a href="/core-econ/03-scarcity-wellbeing-05-decision-making-scarcity.html" class="show-page-number"
              >Unit 3</a
            >. She wants to find a point in the feasible set of combinations of free time and consumption that gives her
            the highest possible utility.
          </p>
          <p>
            Like Karim, she will choose the point where the feasible frontier reaches the highest possible indifference
            curve. Work through Figure 5.7 to find how much grain she will produce, and how much free time she will
            take.

                  At point A, the indifference curve is tangent to the feasible frontier. So her two trade-offs balance
                  out: her marginal rate of substitution (MRS) between grain and free time (the slope of the
                  indifference curve) is equal to the MRT (the slope of the feasible frontier).

            The diagram shows that Angela will choose point A, with 16 hours of free time and 46 bushels of grain, where
            her two trade-offs balance: the trade-off she is willing to make between grain and free time (her MRS) is
            equal the trade-off she is constrained to make by her technology (the MRT).
          </p>
          <p class="keep-together">
            Thinking about the trade-offs gives you another way to understand why this is the best she can do. Suppose,
            for example, that she had chosen to have more than 16 hours of free time. Then her feasible frontier is
            steeper and her indifference curves are flatter than at A, so MRT &gt; MRS. This means she could transform
            an hour of free time into more grain than the least amount she would be willing to accept for the loss of
            free time. So she can increase her utility by reducing her free time. Similarly, if she had chosen to have
            less free time, where MRT &lt; MRS, she could increase her utility by taking more free time and having less
            grain.
          </p>
          <p>
            We can think of the combination of free time and grain at point A as a measure of Angela’s standard of
            living. Figure 5.8 summarizes the outcome.

                problems to analyse Angela’s choice of working hours as an independent farmer with quasi-linear
                preferences. The methods were explained in
                <a href="https://tinyco.re/4704296" class="show-url">Extension 3.5</a>, which you may need to re-read
                before reading this extension. We consider both the general case, and a particular example.

              As an independent farmer, Angela divides her day between work and free time. Her work produces an amount
              of grain, \(y\), which she also consumes. Her daily hours of free time are denoted by \(t\) and the number
              of bushels of grain she consumes per day by \(c\).

              >: that is, by applying the condition \(\text{MRT}=\text{MRS}\), or by using the constraint to substitute
              for \(c\) in the objective function \(u\), and differentiating. Either way, the first-order condition
              gives us the equation:
            </p>
            \[v'(t) = g'(24-t)\]
            <p>
              The utility-maximizing choice of \(t\) must satisfy this equation. Once we know \(t\), we can find the
              corresponding value of \(c\) from the constraint:
            </p>
            \[c=g(24-t)\]
            <h3 id="an-example">An example</h3>
            <p>
              Suppose that in Angela’s quasi-linear utility function \(u(t,\ c) = v(t) + c\), the function \(v(t)\) is
              given by:
            </p>
            \[v(t) = 4\sqrt{t}\]
            <p>
              You can verify by differentiating that this function is increasing and concave, as required for convex
              quasi-linear preferences.
            </p>
            <p>
              Secondly, assume that Angela’s production function is \(y=2\sqrt{2h}\), where \(h\) is hours of work. Then
              the equation of her feasible frontier is:
            </p>
            \[c = 2\sqrt{2(24-t)}\]
            <p>
              Again, you can verify, by differentiating, that the feasible frontier is downward-sloping and concave. The
              marginal rates of transformation and substitution are:
            </p>
            \[\text{MRT} = -g'(t) = \frac{2}{\sqrt{48 -2t}}\ \text{ , } \quad \text{MRS} = v'(t) = \frac{2}{\sqrt{t}}\]
            <p>
              The first-order condition, \(\text{MRT} = \text{MRS}\), is: \(\frac{2}{\sqrt{48-2t}}=\frac{2}{\sqrt{t}}\),
              which we can solve to obtain \(t=16\); the corresponding value of \(c\) is \(c=2\sqrt{48-32}=8\).
            </p>
            <p>
              Figure E5.4 shows the solution for this example. Angela chooses to have 16 hours of free time and work for
              eight hours per day. She consumes eight bushels of grain.

              It is clear from the diagram that this is a maximum point, but you can work out the second-order condition
              to check this mathematically.
            </p>
            <h3 id="more-about-the-general-case">More about the general case</h3>
            <p>
              In the example above, there is a single solution to the first-order condition, and it is a maximum point.
              Will this always happen, whatever the functions \(v\) and \(g\)? We consider three questions:
            </p>
            <h4 id="might-there-be-more-than-one-solution">1. Might there be more than one solution?</h4>
            <p>The first-order condition for the general case is:</p>
            \[v'(t) = g'(24-t)\]
            <p>
              Since \(v(t)\) is concave, the left-hand side of the equation, \(v'(t)\), is a decreasing function of
              \(t\) (a downward-sloping line). And since \(g\) is concave, the right-hand side is an increasing function
              of \(t\) (it slopes upward). If the two lines cross, they can only cross once, and the crossing point
              gives us the solution. This tells us that if we can find a solution, it is the only one—it is unique.
            </p>
            <h4 id="can-we-be-sure-there-is-a-solution-to-the-first-order-condition">
              2. Can we be sure there is a solution to the first-order condition?
            </h4>
            <p>
              It is possible that the functions \(g\) and \(v\) are such that two lines don’t cross for feasible values
              of \(t\)—that is, between \(t=0\) and \(t=24\). In that case, there is no feasible solution to the
              first-order condition, and Angela’s best option would either be \(t=0\) or \(t=24\), depending on which
              gives her higher utility (this is known as a ‘corner solution’).
            </p>
            <p>
              Although corner solutions may occur in mathematical problems, they are not usually very interesting
              economically. If we found that Angela, the independent farmer, chose not to work at all, or to work all
              the time, this would suggest that the functions we had chosen for \(v\) or \(g\) were not very plausible
              representations of her utility or technology.
            </p>
            <h4 id="if-there-is-a-solution-to-the-first-order-condition-is-it-a-maximum-point">
              3. If there is a solution to the first-order condition, is it a maximum point?
            </h4>
            <p>
              You can find the second-order condition most easily from the substitution method. The second derivative of
              the objective is:
            </p>
            \[\frac{d^2u}{dt^2}= g''(24-t)+v''(t)\]
            <p>
              Since \(v\) and \(g\) are both concave functions, \(g''\) and \(v''\) are both negative, and this
              expression is negative for all values of \(t\). So a solution to the first-order condition must be a
              maximum.
            </p>
            <p>
              It is the concavity of \(v\) and \(g\) which enables us to answer ‘yes’ to both the first and third
              questions above. When we model economic problems mathematically, we often use general functions (rather
              than specific ones as in the example) and make assumptions about concavity and convexity to simplify the
              mathematics. But we should ensure that we can justify these assumptions by thinking about their economic
              interpretation.
