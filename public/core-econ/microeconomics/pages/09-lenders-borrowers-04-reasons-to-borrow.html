            The desire to smooth one’s consumption (<strong data-term="consumption smoothing"
              >consumption smoothing</strong
            >) means preferring both some now and some later rather than everything now and nothing later or the
            reverse—having nothing now and everything later. For example, a powerful motivation for wanting to bring
            forward buying power is to be able to purchase the necessities of food, rent, phone contract, and
            electricity.

          <p>
            Think about food—the first few bites of a dish are likely to be much more pleasurable than bites from your
            third serving. This is a fundamental psychological reality, sometimes termed the law of satiation of wants:
            the first bite satisfies more intense wants than the 25th bite.

            The desire to smooth consumption is explained by
            <strong data-term="diminishing marginal utility">diminishing marginal utility</strong> of consumption: at a
            given point in time, the value to the individual of an additional unit of consumption declines as more is
            consumed. Diminishing marginal utility implies that we prefer to smooth our consumption, having the same in
            each period of time rather than having a lot sometimes and a little at other times.

          <p>
            Remember that indifference curves join points of equal <strong data-term="utility">utility</strong>. The
            preference for smoothing means that the desire to bring forward consumption from the future to the present
            falls as we move along an indifference curve from left to right. The slope of the indifference curve is the
            <strong data-term="marginal rate of substitution (MRS)">marginal rate of substitution (MRS)</strong> between
            consumption now and in the future. Where future consumption is high and present consumption is low (towards
            the left), an additional unit of present consumption brings more utility than an additional unit of future
            consumption. So the MRS is high and the indifference curve is steep. The MRS falls as we move towards the
            right, so the curve becomes flatter. As a result, the indifference curves are bowed to the origin.

              In its common usage, the word ‘impatience’ refers to some kind of character flaw. This is not how it is
              used in economics. Impatience is not a judgement about a person, it simply means valuing something more
              now than later.

              more now rather than the same amounts now and later.

          <p>
            While diminishing marginal utility (the preference for smoothing) and the associated bowed shape of the
            indifference curves is universal, when we compare people with the <em>same endowment</em>, their preference
            for shifting consumption (that is, the slope of the indifference curve at that point) can differ. This
            brings us to the difference between situational and intrinsic
            <strong data-term="impatience">impatience</strong>.
          </p>
          <p>
            To make the analysis more concrete and memorable, let’s return to Julia. She, like anyone else, could be
            impatient for two reasons:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <em>Situational impatience</em>. Her situation is that she is poor now and will be better off later; she
              prefers to smooth her consumption between now and later, instead of consuming everything later and nothing
              now.
            </li>
            <li>
              <em>Intrinsic impatience.</em> If she is able to consume the same amount in both periods, and is given the
              choice to consume more now and less later, she is intrinsically impatient if she chooses to consume more
              now.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h3 id="situational-impatience-being-present-oriented-because-you-have-less-now-and-more-later">
            Situational impatience: Being present-oriented because you have less now and more later
          </h3>
          <p>
            Situational impatience means that if, like Julia, our situation is that we have nothing now and $100 in the
            next period then the marginal utility of a dollar now is greater than the marginal utility of a dollar next
            period. As a result, we would be willing to give up more than a dollar in the future to get a dollar now.
            This would allow us to smooth our consumption between the two periods.
          </p>

          <p>This is also true if we have lots later and little now, as Figure 9.4a shows.</p>

                Figure 9.4a depicts an individual’s indifference curves for consumption in periods 1 (now) and 2

                <li>
                  The slope of the indifference curve is the marginal rate of substitution between the consumption in
                  the two periods.
                </li>
                <li>The marginal return to consumption now is higher at E than at C.</li>
                <li>
                  The individual’s consumption is more equal across the two periods at E than at C. Therefore, the
                  individual would prefer consumption choice E to C.
                </li>
                <li>Consuming exactly the same amount in the two periods is the individual’s most preferred choice.</li>

              <ul class="mcq-feedback">
                <li>
                  In order to stay on the same indifference curve, the change in utility due to a marginal change in
                  consumption now must be precisely offset by the change in utility due to the change in consumption
                  later.
                </li>
                <li>
                  At E, the individual is consuming more now than at C. Due to diminishing marginal returns to
                  consumption, the individual’s marginal return to consumption now is lower at E than at C.
                </li>
                <li>
                  While consumption is more equal at E than at C, the two points are on the same indifference curve.
                  Therefore, the individual is indifferent between the two.

                <li>
                  The individual’s preferred choice depends on the interest rate (one plus interest rate is the slope of
                  the feasible frontier) and the shape of their indifference curves. The individual’s preferred choice
                  is at F, where the consumption in the two periods is not necessarily equal.

            Intrinsic impatience: How impatient you are as a person
          </h3>
          <p>
            There is a second reason for preferring the good now, called intrinsic impatience. To determine whether
            someone is intrinsically impatient, we ask whether, if they initially had the same amount of the good in
            both periods, they would value more highly having more of the good now than more of it later. Two reasons
            for intrinsic impatience are:
          </p>
          <!--index:
myopia
prudence
-->
          <ul>
            <li>
              <em>Myopia (short-sightedness)</em>: People experience the present satisfaction of hunger or some other
              desire more strongly than they imagine the same satisfaction at a future date.
            </li>
            <li>
              <em>Prudence</em>: People know that the opportunity to consume the good in the future may not be available
              and so choosing present consumption may be a good idea. (For example, you are offered a ‘dream’ holiday,
              which you could take now or next summer—prudence may lead you to take it now.)
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The terms ‘myopia’ and ‘prudence’ are descriptive—they are not judgemental. Whether because of myopia or
            prudence or some combination, most people are intrinsically impatient.
          </p>
          <p>
            To understand what intrinsic impatience means, we compare two points on the same indifference curve in
            Figure 9.4b. Julia’s indifference curve is in black. At point A, she has $50 now and $50 later, so her
            consumption is completely smooth at her initial endowment. We ask how much extra consumption she would need
            to have later in order to compensate her for losing $10 now. Point B on the same indifference curve gives us
            the answer. If she had only $40 now, she would need $62 later in order to stay on the same indifference
            curve and be equally happy. So she needs $12 later to compensate for losing $10 now. Julia has intrinsic
            impatience because rather than preferring to perfectly smooth her consumption, she places more value on an
            additional unit of consumption today than in the future.
          </p>
          <!--index:
-impatience \\ intrinsic
-->
          <p>
            We can use the same reasoning to compare the intrinsic impatience of different people. The blue indifference
            curve that also passes through point A shows the preferences of another person. Point C shows that if they
            gave up $10 today, they would need to have $20 tomorrow to be equally happy. In contrast, Julia only needs
            $12 tomorrow (her indifference curve through point A is shallower), so she is more patient than the other
            person.

            There is another way to find out how intrinsically impatient a person is. Returning to Julia, who will
            receive $100 in the future, we know she wants to borrow. The situation that she is in gives her a strong
            desire to smooth by borrowing. Think about what the shape of Julia’s indifference curve, passing through her
            endowment point, might be. As shown in Figure 9.5, at point A she has a strong preference for increasing
            consumption now.

          <p>Figure 9.5 shows three of Julia’s indifference curves:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><em>Her reservation indifference curve</em>: The curve closest to the origin.</li>
            <li>
              <em>Her reservation indifference curve if she had the $100 now</em>: The next highest curve assumes that
              she has already earned $100.
            </li>
            <li><em>A higher indifference curve</em>.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            For any particular point in the figure, the individual’s impatience is indicated by the steepness of the
            indifference curve. At her endowment point—$100 later, nothing now—shown by point A, her indifference curve
            is very steep. Because she has nothing now, she is very impatient. It means she would be willing to give up
            a substantial amount of consumption later to gain a little bit of consumption now. This could be illustrated
            by a move from point A to A′. The fact that the steepness of the indifference curves differ at the various
            points in the figure illustrates situational impatience (each point in the figure is a different situation).

              A measure of someone’s impatience: how much the person values an additional unit of consumption now

          <p>
            To measure someone’s impatience, namely how much they value an extra unit of consumption now, relative to an
            extra unit of consumption later, we calculate their
            <strong data-term="discount rate">discount rate</strong>. A person’s discount rate, \(\rho\) (economists use
            the Greek letter \(\rho\), or rho, pronounced ‘row’), is calculated as the slope (remember, we take the
            absolute—positive—value) of the indifference curve minus one.
          </p>
          <p>
            Notice in Figure 9.5 that if Julia hypothetically had the $100 now (point B), she would be much less
            impatient; at B, her indifference curve is very flat. Given her very different hypothetical situation at B,
            her desire to smooth her consumption would mean that she would like to have more consumption
            <em>in the future</em> and less now. So she would be willing to give up a dollar now, even if she got less
            than a dollar in return later. This means that smoothing can happen in either direction, moving consumption
            from the future to the present or from the present to the future.
          </p>
          <p>
            The figure shows that not only would Julia be less impatient if she were hypothetically at point B (with
            $100 now) than at point A (in her real situation, having $100 later), but she would also be better off. In
            Figure 9.5, the indifference curve through B is above the indifference curve through A. To understand this,
            notice that when Julia’s utility is at the same level as when she has the $100 in the future, she must be on
            the same indifference curve, that is, the one going through A. You can see that on that indifference curve
            at B′, her consumption is much lower than $100. For the indifference curves shown in Figure 9.5, she values
            $100 later the same as she values half that amount now (B′ is one-half of B). This is because, as a person,
            she has a degree of intrinsic impatience. This helps illustrate why we say that most people are
            intrinsically impatient.

              class="show-page-number"
              >Figure 9.3</a
            >, we will have the answer. Just like other constrained choice models, where there is a feasible set and
            indifference curves, in the model of intertemporal choice, Julia wishes to get to the highest possible
            indifference curve but is limited by her feasible frontier. The highest feasible indifference curve will be
            the one that is tangent to the feasible frontier, shown as point E in
            <a href="/core-econ/09-lenders-borrowers-04-reasons-to-borrow.html#figure-9-6">Figure 9.6</a>. Recall that
            the slope of the feasible frontier depends on the interest rate. This means that Julia borrows just enough
            so that:
          </p>
          \[\begin{align} \text{slope of the indifference curve (MRS) } = \text{ slope of the feasible frontier (MRT)}
          \end{align}\]
          <p>We know that:</p>
          \[\begin{align*} \text{MRS} &amp;= 1 + \rho \\ \text{MRT} &amp;= 1 + r \\ \end{align*}\]
          <p>Therefore:</p>
          \[\begin{align*} \text{MRS} &amp;= \text{MRT} \\ 1 + \rho &amp;= 1 + r \\ \end{align*}\]
          <p>If we subtract 1 from both sides of this equation, we have:</p>
          \[\begin{align*} \rho &amp;= r \\ \text{discount rate} &amp;= \text{rate of interest} \\ \end{align*}\]
          <p>Here, Julia chooses to borrow and consume $56 and repay $62 later, leaving her $38 to consume later.</p>
          <p>
            Now consider how much she would borrow if she had to pay not the 10% interest rate, but the 78% that was the
            average among the Chambar farmers. Figure 9.6 shows that, as before, finding the point of tangency between
            the new feasible frontier given by the 78% interest rate and one of Julia’s indifference curves, she will
            choose point G, meaning that she will borrow much less—$35—to consume now, paying $62 with interest, and
            having $38 to consume later.
          </p>
          <p>The higher ‘price’ of moving consumption forward in time means two things:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <em>She is less well off than with the lower interest rate</em>: Compare her two indifference curves (one
              through E, the other through G).
            </li>
            <li><em>She will borrow less and consume less now</em>: $35 rather than $56.</li>

            In the example we considered above, Julia’s consumption later does not change. But, that need not be the
            case: depending on the shape of her indifference curves, it could be lower or higher. What is certain is
            that with the higher interest rate, she is less well off, so this would tend to push down her consumption
            later (this is an <strong data-term="income effect">income effect</strong>). But the higher interest rate
            makes it costlier to bring consumption forward, which would tend to push up her consumption later (this is a
            <strong data-term="substitution effect">substitution effect</strong>). In the example shown, the two effects
            are of equal size—which is why there is no change in consumption later.
          </p>
          <p>
            Use the analysis in Figure 9.6 to understand how Julia will choose consumption when the interest rate is 10%
            and when it is 78%.

              <p>
                Figure 9.6 depicts Julia’s choice of consumptions in periods 1 and 2. She has no income in period 1
                (now) and an income of $100 in period 2 (later). The current interest rate is 10%. Based on this
                information, read the following statements and choose the correct option(s).
              </p>
              <ul class="mcq-options">
                <li>At F, the interest rate exceeds Julia’s discount rate (degree of impatience).</li>
                <li>At E, Julia is on the highest possible indifference curve, given her feasible set.</li>
                <li>
                  E is Julia’s choice, as she is able to completely smooth out her consumption over the two periods and
                  consume the same amount.
                </li>
                <li>G is not a feasible choice for Julia.</li>
              </ul>
              <ul class="mcq-feedback">
                <li>
                  At F, the slope of the indifference curve is steeper than that of the feasible frontier. Therefore,
                  Julia’s discount rate exceeds the interest rate.
                </li>
                <li>
                  E is on the highest feasible indifference curve because any higher indifference curves would not touch
                  the feasible frontier.
                </li>
                <li>At E, Julia consumes $56 now and $38 later.</li>
                <li>
                  G is in Julia’s feasible set. She does not choose it because it is not the best she can do (it is on a
                  lower indifference curve).

              Use Figure 9.6 to show that the difference in current consumption at the lower and higher interest rate
              (at E and G), namely $23, is composed of an income effect and a substitution effect.
