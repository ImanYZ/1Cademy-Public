              Economists sometimes use this word in a very general way, to mean anything an individual cares about and
              would like to have more of. As well as goods that are sold in a market, it can include (for example) ‘free
              time’ or ‘clean air’.

            <dt class="definition-term">preferences</dt>

          <p class="tighten-5">
            We can think of both free time and total consumption spending as
            <strong data-term="goods">goods</strong> for Karim. Economists use the word ‘good’ to refer to anything that
            people care about, and would like to have more of. We will simplify the model by assuming he doesn’t care
            about anything else; in particular, he doesn’t care about the future, so is not interested in saving any of
            his income. We will also assume that his average spending cannot exceed his earnings (for example, he cannot
            borrow to increase his consumption).
          </p>
          <p>
            Since Karim cares about both goods, his choice of working hours involves thinking about a trade-off: how
            much consumption is he willing to give up, in order to have more free time? To understand the decision Karim
            will make, we need to know his <strong data-term="preferences">preferences</strong>—how much he values the
            two goods, relative to each other.
          </p>
          <p>
            We illustrate his preferences using Figure 3.4, with free time on the horizontal axis and consumption on the
            vertical axis. Free time is defined as all the time that he does not spend working. Every point in the
            diagram represents a different combination of free time and consumption spending. Given his wage, many of
            these combinations will not be possible for Karim. But for the moment we will focus on which combinations he
            would prefer if he could have them.
          </p>
          <p>We can assume that:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              For a given amount of consumption, he prefers a combination with more free time to one with less free
              time. Therefore, even though both A and B in Figure 3.4 correspond to €540 of consumption, Karim prefers A
              because it gives him more free time.
            </li>
            <li>
              Similarly, if two combinations both have 20 hours of free time, he prefers the one with a higher
              consumption.
            </li>
            <li>
              But compare points A and D in the table. Would Karim prefer D (low consumption, plenty of time) or A
              (higher consumption, less time)? One way to find out would be to ask him.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <dl class="definition">
            <dt class="definition-term">utility</dt>
            <dd class="definition-description">
              A numerical indicator of the value that one places on an outcome. Outcomes with higher utility will be
              chosen in preference to lower valued ones when both are feasible.
            </dd>
          </dl>
          <!--index:
utility \\ definition
-->
          <p class="loosen-10">
            Suppose he says he is indifferent between A and D, meaning he would feel equally satisfied with either
            outcome. We say that these two outcomes would give Karim the same
            <strong data-term="utility">utility</strong>. And we know that he prefers A to B, so B provides lower
            utility than A or D.

            In this model, we can think of utility as a measure of Karim’s overall living standards, taking into account
            that he cares about free time as well as consumption.
          </p>
          <p>
            A systematic way to graph Karim’s preferences would be to start by plotting all of the combinations that
            give him the same utility as A and D. We could ask Karim another question: ‘Imagine that you could have the
            combination at A (15 hours of free time, €540). How much consumption, in euros, would you be willing to
            sacrifice for an extra hour of free time?’ Suppose that after due consideration, he answers ‘€94’. Then we
            know that he is indifferent between A and E (16 hours, €446). Then we could ask the same question about
            combination E, and so on until point D. Eventually we could draw up a table like the one in Figure 3.4.
            Karim is indifferent between A and E, between E and F, and so on, which means he is indifferent between all
            of the combinations from A to D.

            Of the three curves drawn in Figure 3.4, the one through A gives higher utility than the one through B. The
            curve through C gives the lowest utility of the three. To describe preferences, we don’t need to know the
            exact utility of each option; we only need to know which combinations provide more or less utility than
            others.

            The curves we have drawn capture our typical assumptions about people’s preferences between two goods. In
            this model of Karim’s preferences, the goods are ‘consumption spending’ and ‘free time’. In other models,
            they will often be particular <strong data-term="consumer good">consumer goods</strong> such as food or
            clothing, and we refer to the person as a consumer. We typically assume the following:

              <em>Indifference curves slope downward due to trade-offs</em>: If you are indifferent between two

            <li>
              <em>Higher indifference curves correspond to higher utility levels</em>: As we move up and to the right in

            <li>
              <em>Indifference curves are usually smooth</em>: Small changes in the amounts of goods don’t cause big

          <p>
            To understand the last property in the list, we plot Karim’s indifference curves again in Figure 3.5. If he
            is at A, with 15 hours of free time and €540 of consumption, he would be willing to sacrifice €94 of
            consumption for an extra hour of free time, taking him to E (remember that he is indifferent between A and
            E). We say that his
            <strong data-term="marginal rate of substitution (MRS)">marginal rate of substitution (MRS)</strong> between
            consumption and free time at A is 94; it is the reduction in his level of consumption that would keep
            Karim’s utility constant following a one-hour increase of free time.
          </p>
          <p class="loosen-5">
            We have drawn the indifference curves as becoming gradually flatter because it seems reasonable to assume
            that the more free time and less consumption he has, the less willing he will be to sacrifice further
            consumption in return for free time, so his MRS will be lower. In Figure 3.5, we have calculated the MRS at
            each combination along the indifference curve. When Karim has more free time and less consumption, the
            MRS—the amount of spending he would give up to get an extra hour of free time—gradually falls.

          <p>
            The MRS corresponds to the slope of the indifference curve, and it falls as we move to the right along the
            curve. If you think about moving from one point to another in Figure 3.5, the indifference curves get
            flatter if you increase the amount of free time, and steeper if you increase consumption. When free time is
            scarce relative to consumption, Karim is less willing to sacrifice an hour for more consumption spending:
            his MRS is high and his indifference curve is steep.
          </p>
          <p class="hyphens-manual loosen-8">
            As the analysis in Figure 3.5 shows, if you move up the vertical line through 15 hours, the indifference
            curves get steeper: the MRS increases. For a given amount of free time, Karim is willing to give up more
            consumption for an additional hour when he has high consumption, compared to when his consumption is low
            (for example, if he is struggling to afford enough food). By the time you reach A, where his consumption is
            €540, the MRS is high; consumption is so plentiful here that he is willing to give up €94 for an extra hour
            of free time.
          </p>
          <p>
            The same reasoning applies if you fix consumption and vary the amount of free time. If you move to the right
            along the horizontal line for €282, the MRS becomes lower at each indifference curve. As free time becomes
            more plentiful, Karim becomes less and less willing to give up consumption for more time.
          </p>
          <p>
            We have said that the MRS corresponds to the slope of the indifference curve, but note that the MRS is a
            positive number, while the slope of the indifference curve is negative. To be precise, the MRS is equal to
            the absolute value of the slope.

              <strong>Exercise 3.2</strong> Your marginal rate of substitution
            </h3>
            <p>
              Imagine that you are offered a job at the end of your university course with a salary per hour (after
              taxes) of £12.50. Your future employer then says that you will work for 40 hours per week, leaving you
              with 128 hours of free time per week. You tell a friend: ‘at that wage, 40 hours is exactly what I would
              like.’
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                Draw a diagram with free time on the horizontal axis and weekly pay on the vertical axis, and plot the
                combination of hours and the wage corresponding to your job offer, calling it A. Assume you need about
                10 hours a day for sleeping and eating, so you may want to draw the horizontal axis with 70 hours at the
                origin.
              </li>
              <li>Now draw an indifference curve so that A represents the hours you would have chosen yourself.</li>
              <li>
                Now imagine you were offered another job requiring 45 hours of work per week. Use the indifference curve
                you have drawn to estimate the level of weekly pay that would make you indifferent between this and the
                original offer.
              </li>
              <li>
                Do the same for another job requiring 35 hours of work per week. What level of weekly pay would make you
                indifferent between this and the original offer?
              </li>
              <li>Use your diagram to estimate your marginal rate of substitution between pay and free time at A.</li>

              In Figure 3.4 (reproduced here as Figure E3.1) we mapped Karim’s preferences by finding points that gave
              him the same utility and joining them with indifference curves. We can compare different points on the
              figure and say which he prefers. But that doesn’t give us a complete description of his preferences: for
              example, if we took two points in the area between two indifference curves in Figure E3.1, we might not be
              able to tell which one he prefers.

                A utility function is a mathematical representation of a person’s preferences for one or more goods. It
                gives a numerical value to the amount of utility the person obtains from each possible combination of
                goods.
              </dd>
            </dl>
            <p>
              To fully describe preferences we use a <strong data-term="utility function">utility function</strong>,
              which tells us how a person’s ‘units of utility’ depend on the goods available. Karim only cares about two
              goods: free time and consumption. If he has \(t\) hours of free time and \(c\) units of consumption, his
              utility can be described by a function:
            </p>
            \[u(t, c)\]
            <p>
              Since both free time and consumption are <em>goods—</em>Karim would like to have as much of each as
              possible—the utility function must have the property such that increasing either \(t\) or \(c\) would
              increase \(u\). We can work out how utility changes if \(t\) increases by finding the partial derivative:
              that is, by differentiating the utility function with respect to \(t\) while treating \(c\) as a constant.
              Similarly we can find the partial derivative with respect to \(c\), to determine how changes in \(c\)
              affect utility. The partial derivatives are written as:
            </p>
            \[\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} \text{ and } \frac{\partial u}{\partial c}\]
            <p>Utility is increasing in \(t\) and \(c\) if:</p>
            \[\frac{\partial u}{\partial t}&gt;0; \frac{\partial u}{\partial c}&gt;0\]
            <p>We say that utility ‘depends positively’ on \(t\) and \(c\).</p>
            <p>
              Karim’s utility function has two arguments. Just as a function of one variable may be represented
              graphically by a curve on a plane, a function of two variables may be represented by a surface in
              three-dimensional space (as we did in
              <a href="/core-econ/02-technology-incentives-04-firms-technology-production.html#figure-e2-1b"
                >Extension 2.4</a
              >). But three-dimensional diagrams can be awkward to handle, so economists usually analyse utility
              graphically using the same technique that is used to represent the three-dimensional space we live in: a
              contour map of the landscape. Contours are lines joining points of equal height above sea level.
              Similarly, indifference curves are the contours of the utility surface, joining points of equal utility.

            <div class="sidenote">
              <p>
                Another example is weather maps, which use lines called isobars to join points of equal air pressure.
              </p>
            </div>
            <p>Karim’s utility function (which we used to draw Figure E3.1) is:</p>
            \[u=(t-6)^2(c-45) \text{ for } t&gt;6, c&gt;45\]
            <p>
              He has subsistence levels of consumption and free time: he needs \(t&gt;6\) and \(c&gt;45\) to get any
              utility at all. With this utility function, his utility at point E (<em>t</em> = 16<em>, c</em> = 446) is
              <em>u</em> = 40,100. You can check that the other points in the table below Figure E3.1 have the same
              level of utility (approximately, but not exactly because the consumption values in the table have been
              rounded to show whole numbers).
            </p>
            <p>
              In many models, the actual numbers for the values of <em>u</em> are not meaningful. The purpose of the
              utility function is to capture <em>preferences—</em>to tell us which of two points has the higher level of
              utility. The level of utility doesn’t matter. We would get exactly the same indifference curves and
              preferences from (for example) the function \(u = 23(t-6)^2(c-45)\).

            <p>
              If you know that the utility function describing a person’s preferences is \(u(t, c)\), then the equation
              of each indifference curve has the form:
            </p>
            \[u(t, c) = u_0\]
            <p>
              where \(u_0\) is a constant corresponding to the level of utility on the curve. With Karim’s utility
              function, the equation of an indifference curve is:
            </p>
            \[(t-6)^2(c-45) = u_0\]
            <p>which can be rearranged to obtain:</p>
            \[c = \frac{u_0}{(t-6)^2} + 45\]
            <p>
              To draw an indifference curve, we can choose a value for \(u_0\) and plot the graph of this relationship,
              with \(t\) on the horizontal axis and \(c\) on the vertical axis. To plot the indifference curves shown in
              Figure E3.1, we started by choosing \(u_0=40,100\) to get the highest indifference curve shown, and then
              plotted two lower ones using \(u_0=21,000\) and \(u_0=8,000\).

              Calculating Karim’s marginal rate of substitution
            </h4>
            <p>
              Karim’s marginal rate of substitution (MRS)—his willingness to trade consumption for an extra hour of free
              time—depends on the combination of goods, \((t, c)\), that he has. It is given by the absolute value of
              the slope of the indifference curve \(u(t, c)=u_0\) through that point.
            </p>
            <p>How can we calculate the slope of the indifference curve \(u(t, c)=u_0\)?</p>
            <p>
              With the particular utility function we used for Karim, this is easy to do using calculus. As before, we
              rewrite the equation of an indifference curve to give \(c\) in terms of \(t\):
            </p>
            \[c = \frac{u_0}{(t-6)^2} + 45\]
            <p>Then we differentiate to find the slope of the curve:</p>
            \[\frac{dc}{dt} = \frac{-2u_0}{(t-6)^3}\]
            <p>
              This gives us an expression for the slope in terms of \(t\) and \(u_0\) (the level of utility at the
              point). But it is often more useful to write it in terms of \(t\) and \(c\), by substituting for \(u_0\)
              using the equation of the indifference curve:
            </p>
            \[\frac{dc}{dt} = \frac{-2(t-6)^2(c-45)}{(t-6)^3} = \frac{-2(c-45)}{(t-6)}\]
            <p>
              This gives us a negative number (for \(c&gt;45\) and \(t&gt;6\))—remember, indifference curves slope
              downward. The MRS is the absolute value of the slope:
            </p>
            \[\text{MRS} = \frac{2(c-45)}{(t-6)}\]
            <p>
              This expression can be used to calculate Karim’s MRS at any combination \((t, c)\) of free time and
              consumption. For example, the MRS at point A (\(t = 15, c = 540\)) is:
            </p>
            \[\text{MRS at A} = \frac{2 \times (540-45)}{15-6} = 110\]
            <p>
              The value of the MRS at A is not identical to the one we obtained in <a href="#figure-3-5">Figure 3.5</a>.
              There, we worked in whole numbers, and defined the MRS as the amount of consumption Karim would trade for
              an increase of one whole hour in free time. At point A, this corresponds to the slope of the straight line
              from A to E. But here we have used calculus to find the MRS at point A using the exact slope of the curve
              at that point—which is slightly different. Either way, however, the MRS is measured in the same units:
              Karim’s MRS is measured in euros per hour.

              The marginal rate of substitution measures <em>a rate of change</em>, usually described by economists as
              the effect of a marginal change. It is one of many examples of marginal changes you will encounter. We
              often model a relationship between two variables, \(x\) and \(y\), as a function \(y=f(x)\), and we want
              to measure how fast \(y\) changes as \(x\) increases: that is, the rate of change of \(y\) with respect to
              \(x\). We describe this as the <strong data-term="marginal change">marginal change</strong> in \(y\) in

              When we draw a graph of the function, the effect of a marginal change is measured by the slope of the line

              <p>
                We use two ways of defining and measuring marginal changes in a relationship between two variables,

              <ul>
                <li>
                  If \(x\) is measured in whole numbers only, the marginal change in \(y\) is defined as the change in
                  \(y\) when \(x\) increases by one unit. This is the interpretation we use in the main sections of the
                  book.
                </li>
                <li>
                  If \(y\) is a continuous function of \(x\), the marginal change in \(y\) is measured by the derivative
                  of \(y\) with respect to \(x\). This calculus method is used in the mathematical extensions.

              </ul>
              <p>
                Remember that a derivative captures the effect of an infinitesimal change in \(x\). So if the units are
                small, these two methods give almost the same answer: if \(y=f(x)\), \(\frac{df}{dx}\approx

              and \(\frac{\partial u}{\partial c}\) is the marginal utility of consumption. Marginal utilities are
              closely related to the MRS, as explained below.

              The marginal rate of substitution: A general formula
            </h3>
            <p>
              We calculated Karim’s MRS by rearranging the particular equation for his indifference curves and
              differentiating to find their slopes. For a general utility function \(u(t, c)\) we can find the slope of
              the indifference curve using the marginal utilities, \(\frac{\partial u}{\partial t}\) and
              \(\frac{\partial u}{\partial c}\).
            </p>
            <p>
              We apply a technique called implicit differentiation, which is useful in many economic models. Here, the
              method involves considering how consumption would need to change if free time increased by a small amount,
              in order to keep utility constant.
            </p>
            <p>
              Starting from a point on the indifference curve \(u(t, c)=u_0\), suppose both \(t\) and \(c\) change by
              small amounts, \(\Delta t\) and \(\Delta c\). The small increments formula for functions of two variables
              gives an approximation to the change in utility \(\Delta u\), expressing it as the sum of a ‘free time
              effect’ and a ‘consumption effect’:
            </p>
            \[\Delta u \approx \frac{\partial u}{\partial t} \Delta t + \frac{\partial u}{\partial c} \Delta c\]
            <p>
              If the small changes, \(\Delta t\) and \(\Delta c\), are chosen so that we move to a point on the same
              indifference curve, utility does not change. In that case \(\Delta u=0\), which implies that:
            </p>
            \[\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} \Delta t + \frac{\partial u}{\partial c} \Delta c \approx 0\]
            <p>Rearranging:</p>
            \[\frac{\Delta c}{\Delta t} \approx - \frac{\partial u}{\partial t} \bigg/ \frac{\partial u}{\partial c}\]
            <p>
              The changes \(\Delta t\) and \(\Delta c\) together produce a small movement along an indifference curve.
              So if we now take the limit as \(\Delta t \rightarrow 0\), the left-hand side approaches the slope of the
              curve and the approximation becomes an equation.
            </p>
            <p>Therefore the slope of the indifference curve through any point \((t, c)\) is given by the formula:</p>
            \[\frac{dc}{dt} = -\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} \bigg/ \frac{\partial u}{\partial c}\]
            <p>
              The right-hand side of this equation is negative, provided that both marginal utilities are positive
              (increasing either free time or consumption increases utility). This formula shows that for any utility
              function with positive marginal utilities, the indifference curves slope downward, as in the diagram. The
              marginal rate of substitution (MRS) is the absolute value of the slope:
            </p>
            \[\text{MRS} = \frac{\partial u}{\partial t} \bigg/ \frac{\partial c}{\partial c}\]
            <p>or, in words,</p>
            \[\text{marginal rate of substitution} = \frac{\text{marginal utility of free time}}{\text{marginal utility

            <p>Applying this formula to Karim’s utility function \(u=(t-6)^2(c-45)\), the marginal utilities are:</p>
            \[\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} = 2(t-6)(c-45) \ \text{and} \ \frac{\partial u}{\partial c} = (t-6)^2\]
            <p>So the MRS is given by:</p>
            \[\text{MRS} = \frac{2(t-6)(c-45)}{(t-6)^2} = \frac{2(c-45)}{(t-6)}\]

                A person whose indifference curves have a convex shape—they get flatter as you move along the curve to
                the right of the diagram—is said to have convex preferences. This typical shape arises because when
                someone has more of one good (relative to another) they are willing to give up more of it in exchange
                for a unit of the other good: their marginal rate of substitution falls along the curve.

              Each indifference curve in Figure E3.1 becomes flatter as you move along it to the right: in other words,
              Karim’s MRS falls along the indifference curve as \(t\) increases. You can infer this from the expression
              \(\text{MRS}=\frac{2(c-45)}{(t-6)}\): as we move down an indifference curve, \(t\) in the denominator
              increases and \(c\) in the numerator decreases, so the MRS becomes smaller.
            </p>
            <p>
              This property of Karim’s preferences is known as diminishing marginal rate of substitution and is usually
              assumed when we draw indifference curves with two goods. The more you have of a good, the more willing you
              are to trade it for the other.
            </p>
            <p>
              Another way to describe this property is to say that Karim’s indifference curves are convex. A curve is
              said to be convex if, when you draw a straight line between any two points on the curve, the line lies
              above the curve. Since Karim’s indifference curves have this shape, we say that he has
              <strong data-term="convex preferences">convex preferences</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>
              We can check this algebraically for Karim’s utility function \(u=(t-6)^2(c-45)\), by again writing the
              indifference curve as a function of \(t\):
            </p>
            \[c = \frac{u_0}{(t-6)^2} + 45\]
            <p>Differentiating with respect to \(t\) holding \(u_0\) constant:</p>
            \[\frac{dc}{dt} = \frac{-2u_0}{(t-6)^3} \ \text{and so MRS =} \ \frac{2u_0}{(t-6)^3}\]
            <p>Differentiating again:</p>
            \[\frac{d \text{MRS}}{dt} = \frac{-6u_0}{(t-6)^4} &lt; 0\]
            <p>and so MRS is diminishing as \(t\) increases along the curve.</p>
            <p>
              A person whose preferences are convex always prefers mixtures of goods to extremes of either good. If we
              draw a straight line between two points on the same indifference curve, then each point on the line is a
              ‘mixture’ (that is, a weighted average) of the two end points. When the indifference curves are convex,
              all points on the line between the end points give higher utility than the end points.

            <h3 id="the-cobbdouglas-utility-function">The Cobb–Douglas utility function</h3>
            <p>Suppose that Karim has a different utility function:</p>
            \[u (t, c)= t^\alpha c^\beta\]
            <p>
              where \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\) are positive constants. This function has some very convenient mathematical
              properties. It is called a Cobb–Douglas function after the two people who introduced it into economics.
            </p>
            <p>
              To draw Karim’s indifference curves, we again rearrange the expression above to find an equation for \(c\)
              in terms of \(t\), at a particular level of utility \(u_0\):
            </p>
            \[c=\left(\frac{u_0}{t^\alpha}\right)^\frac{1}{\beta}\]
            <p>
              To find the marginal utilities of free time and consumption, we must find the partial derivatives of the
              utility function. Differentiating \(u\) with respect to \(t\), the marginal utility of free time is:
            </p>
            \[\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} = \alpha t^{\alpha -1} c^\beta\]
            <p>
              We know from the utility function that \(t^{\alpha -1} c^\beta = u/t\), which gives us a simpler
              expression for the marginal utility of free time:
            </p>
            \[\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} = \frac{\alpha u}{t}\]
            <p>Similarly, the marginal utility of consumption is:</p>
            \[\frac{\partial u}{\partial c} = \beta t^{\alpha} c^{\beta-1} = \frac{\beta u}{c}\]
            <p>
              When \(t\) and \(c\) are positive, so is \(u\). Hence the assumption that \(\alpha\) is also positive
              implies that \(\partial u/\partial t \gt 0\). Similarly, \(\beta\gt 0\) implies that \(\partial u/\partial
              c \gt 0\). In other words, the assumption that both \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\) are positive ensures that
              ‘goods are good’: Karim’s utility rises as free time or consumption increases.
